"LAW,BK 987,Securitization,"Securitization and structured finance together constitute one of the most  dynamic segments of the financial markets. Securitization involves the creation  and issuance of securities backed by one or more assets which generate cash  flows sufficient to fund the securities. Structured finance includes  securitization as well as transactions in which securities are not issued, but  which involve the often complex structuring of cash flows to achieve a desired  tax, accounting or financial objective. These transactions often cut across many  areas of legal specialization, including bank and thrift regulation, securities  regulation, taxation, bankruptcy and insolvency, fiduciary law, real estate law  and environmental law. This course examines a series of actual transactions to  explore the sometimes contradictory ways that these various legal constructs  impinge upon the structuring transactions. Examples include single-family  mortgage pools, trade receivable securitizations and commercial mortgage  securitizations. This course also explores some of the more cutting-edge  securitizations of exotic asset classes such as legal fees, intellectual  property and renewable energy assets.

"LAW,BK 990,Government Regulation of Insurance,"The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), better known as health  care reform, is the most important  and controversial piece of federal social  legislation of this generation.  It is also basically an insurance regulatory  statute. PPACA establishes a new and complex set of rules governing the  operation of the health insurance industry, provides consumers with important  rights with respect to access to medical care and imposes obligations with  respect to health insurance on both businesses and individuals.  The course will  look at PPACA and the issues that surrounded its enactment--issues which  continue to fuel debate over whether it should modified or repealed. This will  be done as part of an examination of the regulatory rules that govern all of  insurance industry?s products (annuities, auto, home owners? product liability,  life insurance, etc).  The course also takes a look at the insurance industry?s  structure and financial performance and at the competitive interactions between  the insurance, banking and securities industries. The impact on the industry of  the financial crisis of 2008 and the resulting Dodd-Frank reform legislation  will be reviewed.     "LAW,BK 991,Commercial Lending,"This course studies the legal problems involved in documenting various types of  financing transactions ranging from short-term unsecured loans which are based  on the borrower's general credit to long-term, asset-based financings in which  the lender does not have recourse to the borrower's general assets. The  documentation process is followed from the preparation of the initial term sheet  through the rendering of legal opinions at closing. The major aspects of a loan  agreement, specifically representations and warranties, lending provisions,  closing conditions, pricing, covenants, and defaults, are studied in detail in  an effort to insure that each student understands the mechanics of a financing  transaction. The special legal problems involved in inventory and receivables  financing, project financing, construction credits, and leasing transactions are  highlighted. Subordination agreements, participation agreements, and other  inter-creditor arrangements are discussed. The provisions of the Bank Holding  Company Act that relate to financing transactions, bank legal lending limits,  margin requirements, and usury are considered. A discussion format is employed  to the extent feasible, and problems and illustrations are used to focus and  encourage class participation. The grade is based on a final examination, class  participation and a brief analytical paper.     "LAW,BK 995,Consumer Financial Services,"This class presents an overview of the laws relating to traditional and innovative consumer financial products and services, including the impact of the new consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank banking law on creditors and consumers.  The course focuses on federal consumer financial laws governing installment, revolving, and real estate lending, credit and debit cards; and ATM networks, point of sale payment systems, home banking, stored value and prepaid cards; and other deposit and loan products and services. The course examines the design of retail financial products and considers operational issues, the regulatory framework, and consumer protection laws including The Consumer Financial Protection Act, Truth in Lending, Equal Credit Opportunity, Community Reinvestment Acts, and federal and state laws governing fair credit reporting, trade practices, usury, electronic funds transfers, and funds availability.

"LAW,JD 805,Business Law,"Secured Financing Transactions Many commercial financing transactions involve the creation of security interests in the borrower's personal property that are akin to mortgages of real property.  Much business credit is provided on a secured credit - if security is unavailable, credit markets can dry up.  Additionally, the debt obligation can be packaged with others and serve as the backing for securities akin to those that have recently been much in the news.

This seminar will analyze the unique role, power, and responsibilities of the prosecutor in the United States criminal justice system.  How does a prosecutor balance her duty to ""seek justice"" and her role as a ""minister of justice"" within an adversarial system?  Does public pressure (perceived or real) to obtain convictions and solve crimes have an impact on prosecutors' actions?   Throughout this course, we will examine the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, the Model Code of Professional Responsibility, and the Standards of Criminal Justice as they apply to criminal attorneys in general and prosecutors in particular.  How do the rules and case law demonstrate that a criminal prosecutor is different from a criminal defense attorney or civil attorney?  We will study the ethical implications and constraints placed on prosecutors, as well as the unique power that they hold at various stages of a criminal case.  We will examine the means by which a prosecutor exercises discretion from the investigation of alleged crimes to the decision to charge (or not charge), and through the conduct of trials, as well as post-trial obligations.  We will address such topics as What is the prosecutor's obligation to the police and/or alleged victims of crimes?  What duty does a prosecutor owe to a criminal defendant?  What restrictions are placed on a prosecutor at trial that do not exist for defense attorneys?  We will also study some specific contemporary and historical cases that have raised questions about the ethical conduct of prosecutors, including (but not limited to) the so-called Duke Lacrosse case, the Dominque Strauss-Kahn matter, and the prosecution of United States Senator Ted Stevens and the subsequent findings of prosecutorial misconduct therein.

Topics will include the ethics of engaging with other professionals (e.g., social workers, medical professionals, etc.) as well as how to approach legal issues with a multi-disciplinary lens. For example, in the human trafficking context, courts have adopted diversion programs and ""John"" schools to alleviate the harsh implications of the criminal justice system while providing more effective protection to human trafficking survivors. Students will examine these approaches and the limitations of various models.  Requirements include active class participation, journals, and a final paper.    "LAW,JD 818,Advanced Human Trafficking (C),"Students will continue to represent human trafficking survivors in a variety of contexts. They will be expected to contribute ten hours per week to represent human trafficking survivors.

"LAW,JD 824,Juvenile Delinquency (S),"The American juvenile justice system was established over one hundred years ago to address the problem of young offenders.  This course examines the historical, social and legal foundations for our current system.  We will examine the issue of ""rights"" as applied to children and  look at the effects of ideology and politics on the current juvenile justice system.  How have assumptions of childhood and responsibility changed?  Has the juvenile court been ""criminalized"" with the introduction of due process rights for children?  Under what circumstances are children treated as adult offenders?  Selected issues for inquiry include police interrogation of juveniles; school safety and zero tolerance policies; adjudicative competency; anti-youth crime policies; conditions of incarceration; and changes brought about by elimination of mandatory juvenile life without parole.  We will examine these issues through use of court cases, law review articles, governmental and private organizational position papers,  and legislative history.  Using the Massachusetts model, one of the early and often emulated juvenile systems, we will examine the changes in the prosecution and incarceration of juveniles over the past century.  As we consider the overarching issue of whether it makes sense to maintain a separate justice system for juveniles, we will compare our system to those of other nations.  We will visit the Boston Juvenile Court to observe a delinquency session and speak with court personnel.  Students are expected to attend each class prepared to discuss the assigned readings.

Thus, all privately owned economic entities are subject to or affected by the antitrust laws (federal or state), ranging from the largest multinationals to self-employed individuals, e.g., lawyers.  Antitrust law constrains business behavior that injures the competitive process, encompassing such topics as price fixing, boycotts, monopolization, mergers, price discrimination, distributorship limitations and similar trade restrictions.

Through the program, students gain hands-on legal experience under the supervision of practitioners who are experts in their fields. Students receive variable credits (pass/fail) for the fieldwork component of the externship, determined as follows 3 credits = 150 hours total; 4 credits = 200 hours total; and 5 credits = 250 hours total.  The student's schedule and hours are determined in consulation with the placement supervisors. Some placements require 250 hours. The fieldwork begins the first week of classes and students work through the last week of classes. Students may not begin the fieldwork before the semester begins.  Upon acceptance, Professor Lois Knight works with students to identify suitable field placements depending on each student's individual interests and career goals. Once possible placement organizations are identified, students are responsible for applying to those organizations.  Although there are no formal prequisites, some classes are highly recommended. For any litigation-based placement, you should have taken Evidence. For any criminal placement, in particular the criminal division of the US Attorney's Office, you should have taken Criminal Procedure. Additionally, you should take any other substantive law class that will help you understand the law related to your placement. For example, if you want to work at an environmental placement, you should take an environmental law class. COREQUISITE Legal Externship Program"LAW,JD 925,Legal Externship Program,"Legal Ethics The Legal Externship is a one-semester clinical program. Students are required to apply and be accepted to the program before they may register. The weekly seminar is required of all Legal Externship participants.  An integral part of the externship, this two hour weekly seminar examines legal practice and the ethics of lawyering. The seminar requires students to write a paper and make a class presentation.

NOTE The seminar satisfies the Law School's professional responsibility requirement. COREQUISITE Legal Externship Program"LAW,JD 927,International Law,"This course will offer a basic survey of contemporary international law. It will teach students the minimum that every lawyer should know about the major issues of public international law and policy that influence current events and modern legal practice. It will also provide a foundation for those interested in further study of particular topics covered. We will consider both the historical ""law of nations"" and post-World War II developments, which have shifted the fulcrum of the system from an exclusive focus on the rights and duties of states inter se to a broader focus on all the diverse participants in the contemporary international legal process not only states but intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations, insurgents, multinational business enterprises, terrorist and criminal associations, and individuals. Specific topics will include (i) the history, nature, sources and efficacy of international law; (ii) the establishment, transformation and termination of states and other actors, including international institutions and, in particular, the United Nations; (iii) the domestic incorporation of international law, with a focus on key concepts of U.S. foreign relations law; (iv) the allocation among states of jurisdiction to prescribe and apply law, as well as jurisdictional immunities; (v) human rights, the laws of war, and international criminal law; (vi) the allocation of control over and regulation of the resources of the planet, including the law of the sea, territory, the environment, and the global economy; and (vii) the use of force. The role of power in the international legal system will be candidly acknowledged-and the problems and opportunities it presents explored. Current international events will be woven into the curriculum as appropriate. Examination.  "LAW,JD 928,Shareholder Activism (S),"In recent years, shareholder activism has transformed the way public companies are run.  Many shareholders are no longer content to passively defer to senior managers and boards of directors while quietly collecting their dividends and hoping for share price appreciation.  This course will explore various forms of shareholder activism.  We will examine the debate over proxy access and its successful inclusion in Dodd-Frank, say-on-pay initiatives, majority voting for directors, the corporate governance reform movement, and shareholder litigation, touching on both securities fraud class actions and deal litigation.  We will examine the debate over socially responsible investing and the problems posed by corporations' use of shareholder dollars to make campaign contributions, particularly in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in Citizens United.  In examining these debates we will discuss the costs and benefits of such activism.  Students will also develop an appreciation for the institutional players that drive this activism, and for those that oppose it.  PREREQUISITE Corporations (may be waived with instructor's permission).  NOTE A limited number of students may be permitted to satisfy the upper-class writing requirement with the approval of the instructor. GRADING NOTICE This course does not offer the CR/NC/H option. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.

"LAW,JD 931,Private Equity and Venture Capital Transactions (S),"This seminar introduces students to the business and legal issues prevalent in private equity and venture capital deals and highlights the significant role that lawyers play in effecting these transactions.  The seminar will begin with an overview of the private equity and venture capital industries, an introduction to investment transactions and will proceed through all aspects of the life of an investment from inception to exit.  It will address how investment funds are formed and the legal and financial considerations present when those funds invest in private companies.  We will examine deal terms and structures, pricing and corporate finance issues, and the management of deal risk.  It will also highlight the due diligence process, stockholder relationships, fiduciary duties and securities laws considerations, and liquidity events.  Theoretical readings will be balanced against practical articles and commentary, recent court decisions and model deal documents.  The seminar will be highlighted by guest lectures by private equity and venture capital investment professionals.  Grades will be based on a final exam, short pre-class exercises and class participation.  PREREQUISITE Corporations (May be waived with an instructor's permission.)  RESTRICTION  Students may enroll in this seminar even though they have previously taken the Deals course, but students may not take Deals after they have taken this seminar.

"LAW,JD 932,Admiralty,"Admiralty cases comprise a significant portion of the case load of federal courts near U.S. ports.  Clerks for judges in those courts should have an understanding of admiralty law.  In addition, lawyers who handle international transactions will likely encounter admiralty issues even if they do not specialize in admiralty law.  The practice of admiralty law is by its nature international.  Admiralty practitioners work with lawyers and clients from many nations and travel often to those nations.  The course will examine admiralty jurisdiction of the federal and state courts as well as oft litigated choice of law and choice of forum issues.  Our examination of the substantive areas of admiralty law will show how they fit together and affect one another.  The substantive areas will include the international and domestic multimodal carriage of goods, charter parties (contracts to use an entire ship or part of a ship), salvage, towing, pilotage, collision, stranding, general average, and personal injury.  We shall also examine ship mortgages and marine insurance.  Marine insurance affects almost all aspects of admiralty law.  We shall attempt to predict the affects of the Rotterdam Rules (a new treaty that the United States and other nations are in the process of ratifying) on various aspects of admiralty law, particularly the carriage of goods. This course is a pre-requisite to apply for membership in the three student Judge John R. Brown Admiralty Moot Court Competition, which will be held in Charleston, S.C. from March 19 to 21, 2015. Applicants must also participate before March 19, 2015 in the Stone Moot Court Competition. OFFERING PATTERN This class is not offered every year.  Students are advised to take this into account when planning their long-term schedule.   "LAW,JD 933,Anarchism (S),"Anarchism is usually by treated political philosophers as either a starting point for statist theories (Nozick) or as a reductio in arguments against opposing theories (""But that's anarchy!""), but very little attempt is made to consider it as a plausible alternative to statist theories.  In this course we will discuss the varieties of anarchisms and a range of issues connected to it  the obligation to obey the law, the nature of political consent, the nature of justification and legitimacy.  We will also discuss historical examples of anarchism and a wide range of theorists past and present from Bakunin and Goldmann to Simmons and Huemer. Written work will consist of two papers, 2500-3500 words each, one due around mid-term, the other due at the end of the term.  Each will address a theoretical issue directly related to one or more of the issues that will have already been addressed in the seminar.  One of each student's papers will be read by one of the instructors, the other one will be read by the other instructor. The seminar will be open to both upper-class law students and graduate students in philosophy.  The seminar will meet in STH 541 on Thursdays 4:20-6:20 pm but will follow the Law School's calendar, meeting from January 15 through April 16.   ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar, or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, will be administratively dropped from the seminar. Students who wait list for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment.      "LAW,JD 934,Affordable Housing Law Externship,"Fieldwork (C) Through the Affordable Housing Externship Program, students receive credit for an externship done in conjunction with the Affordable Housing and Community Development seminar (JD935), taught by Mr. Peter Freeman.  Students receive 3 credits (C/NC) for performing 150 hours of fieldwork (about 12 hours per week), and 3 credits (graded) for the weekly seminar.  The solutions to the ongoing problem and challenge of providing affordable housing and sustainable community development in our nation's cities and towns will occur only through the interdisciplinary efforts of lawyers, community groups, financial institutions, architects, engineers, planners and governmental agencies (at the local, state and federal levels). The Affordable Housing Externship Program provides opportunities for students to interface directly with the players mentioned above. ""Learning the law"" in this field is therefore enhanced immeasurably.  The externship component offers the opportunity for students to experience how various laws, tools and programs come together in the real world to achieve the goal - project by project and case by case - of providing affordable housing and sustainable community development. Boston has a great wealth of public and non-profit housing and community development agencies, each providing a great experience for students. Students must submit an application for the Externship by April 15.  Please contact Mr. Freeman for more information about specific placement possibilities.   "LAW,JD 935,Affordable Housing Law (S),"The seminar will combine a focus on 1) public policy issues related to the goals of creation of affordable housing in the context of community revitalization; and 2) real-world implementation strategies that have been successfully used to achieve these goals.  Analyzing the roles of government agencies, non-profit organizations, neighborhood groups, and private businesses will be a key part of the seminar.  In lieu of a traditional exam or term paper, students will engage in field research and investigation of real community projects as part of semester long case studies, where they will work with lawyers, government officials, developers and grass-roots advocates involved with the projects.  The relative utility of traditional legal techniques (such as land use planning devices,  zoning, easements, revolving trusts, leasehold covenants and financing) will be carefully analyzed; the policies and impact of federal, state and local laws, including federal and state affordable housing financing programs and the Community Preservation Act in Massachusetts, will be examined; and possible new approaches will be considered.  By incorporating real-world projects into the seminar, it is hoped that the interface of law, economics, planning, design, and construction disciplines will enable the problems to be analyzed from a variety of perspectives reflecting a client's and a community's practical concerns.  LIMITED WRITING REQUIREMENT OPTION  A limited number of students may be permitted to satisfy the upper-class writing requirement with the approval of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. CLINIC OPTION A limited number of students may apply to enroll in the Affordable Housing Law Externship Program (JD934).

Students who are on a wait list for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment. "LAW,JD 936,International Development and Project Finance (S),"Capital-intensive public and private development projects throughout the world, including large-scale infrastructure, transportation, energy, agriculture, technology and environmental projects depend upon project financing as the primary funding mechanism.  Understanding and resolving the political, legal and financial risks associated with the planning and implementation of these projects, and often in emerging and unstable economies, is the critical first step in developing project finance opportunities.  The seminar will combine theory and practice and focus on the negotiation and structure of actual project finance and concession agreements and transactions and the minimization of exposures and risks associated with these transactions.  Each step of the project finance process will be analyzed, including the rationale and sources for the project finance, the legal framework for the project finance, the organizational and governance structure, risk allocation and mitigation and dispute resolution.  An interdisciplinary analysis from the legal, finance and public perspective will be used to assess the views that investors, lenders, designers, contractors, governmental participants, citizens and other stakeholders bring to an infrastructure project.  Several of the world's largest and most complex civil engineering and infrastructure mega projects including the English Chunnel, the Chad Cameroon Pipeline, the Dabhol Power Project and Boston's Central Artery Tunnel Project will serve as models for analysis of project finance and risk.  A final research paper will be required in lieu of an examination.  NOTE This seminar satisfies the Upper-class Professional Skills requirement.  LIMITED WRITING REQUIREMENT OPTION A limited number of students may be permitted to satisfy the upper-class writing requirement.  **A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.

OFFERING PATTERN This class not offered every year.  Students are advised to take this into account when planning their long-term schedule.    "LAW,JD 941,Corporate Governance (S),"This seminar will address corporate governance issues from an historical as well as current perspective.  In addressing the legal framework of corporate governance for the modern U.S. corporation, we will consider the implications for corporate governance posed by different players, including investors, independent directors, corporate management, employees and other stakeholders.  Throughout our discussions, we will seek to take into account the roles played by courts, legislatures, and regulatory bodies, as well as the challenges and responsibilities of lawyers who advise their clients in various settings.  In addition to discussion of legal academic writings, cases and relevant laws, we will engage in a number of role-playing exercises in class.  For example, students may be called upon to play various roles in a simulated annual meeting of shareholders involving a campaign to withhold votes to elect a company's board chairman or to play the role of legal advisers to independent directors of a company's board who are called upon to negotiate the compensation of the company's chief executive officer.  There is no exam in this course.  Each student will be required to write one short paper (up to 5 pages) that will cover a topic for a given class and will be responsible for leading (or co-leading with one or more other students) the discussion on that topic for a substantial portion of that class.  In this regard, the student or students responsible for leading the discussion in a given class will also be asked to identify and post an additional reading for that class.  Each student will also be required to write a longer paper of publishable quality due at the end of the semester.

"LAW,JD 946,Criminal Law,"Examines the basic principles of substantive criminal law, including the justifications for punishment, the essential elements of offenses, mitigating and exculpating defenses, and different forms of criminal liability.    "LAW,JD 948,Immigrants & the Law (S)," Recent census data informs us that there are approximately 40 million immigrants living in the United States.  About 11 million of these immigrants are undocumented or otherwise in the country illegally.  The rest of the country remains divided on their feelings regarding the immigrant population, with about half believing that immigrants ""strengthen the country because of their hard work and talent, while 41% [believe them to be] a burden because they take jobs, health care and housing.""  1 This course will investigate the life of an immigrant in American society from a legal perspective.  Students will learn how immigrants, both documented and undocumented, interact with various sections of the American system.  The goal is to assess various ways in which an individual's immigration status affects access to important rights and benefits accorded to citizens and analyze the legal rationale for existing limitations.  We will examine these issues through the use of law review articles, court cases, existing and proposed legislation, newspaper articles, empirical studies, and governmental and private organizational position papers. Topics may include an investigation of an immigrant's access and limitations in primary and secondary education, public benefits, the court system, employment, voting, as well as modes of immigration policing by both federal immigration authorities and state police. LIMITED WRITING REQUIREMENT OPTION A limited number of students may be permitted to satisfy the upper-class writing requirement.

"LAW,JD 950,Homicide Investigations and Trials,"Theory and Practice (S) This seminar will focus upon the substantive law of homicide, as well as the practical aspects of actual homicide investigations and trials  crime scene interpretation; DNA analysis; autopsies and related forensic evidence; expert testimony, particularly in the area of psychiatry and criminal responsibility; jury considerations; ethical concerns; and the role of the media. Students will have the opportunity to study actual murder cases, visit local crime laboratories and courtrooms, and learn prosecution, defense, and judicial perspectives on various contemporary issues arising in murder investigations and trials.  NOTE  This seminar satisfies the Upper-class Professional Skills requirement.  LIMITED WRITING REQUIREMENT OPTION"LAW,JD 951,Comparative Law (S),"This seminar is an introduction to comparative law's themes and methods.  Accordingly, the seminar is organized in two parts.  The readings selected for the first part present theoretical articulations and practical applications of the main methodological approaches relied upon by comparative lawyers.  Participants will become acquainted with the ""mechanics"", as well as the broader implications, of the various ways of comparing functionalism, structuralism, culturalism, postmodern neo-culturalism and critical comparative law.  The materials discussed in the second part explore how these different methodologies play out in recent and heated comparative law debates. Participants will be asked to reflect over the common law-civil law dichotomy and its implications for the debate over the European Civil Code as well as for projects of harmonization, such as the World Bank's ""Legal Origins"" study; the circulation of legal rules and institutions and the export of constitutional models in Eastern Europe and Iraq; the ambiguous relation between US and European legal cultures and the debate over different ideas of ""privacy""; the ""West"" and the ""Orient"" in family law reform. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.

"LAW,JD 952,Copyright Law,"Copyright is one of the major legal regimes governing art, software, information, and entertainment, and its rules deeply affect how the internet operates. This course is a policy and skills-oriented study of federal copyright law.    Much of copyright policy can be clarified by using some basic tools from economics and philosophy; these analytic tools will be taught during the course, and no prior knowledge is required. As for skills, the course focuses on two how to tackle and master a complex set of interrelated statutory provisions, and how to articulate legal principles orally in a way that would be comprehensible to an untutored judge.  Rather than having a predominant lecture format, the course puts student analysis at its center.  The course will cover the exclusive rights granted to creators of ""original works of authorship"", the authorial subject-matters eligible for federal copyright, the nature of an infringement action, and defenses such as fair use. In addition, students will be expected to master at least one detailed, statute-governed topic such as duration (how long do rights over a given work of authorship remain in private hands before becoming free for all to copy) or the inalienable right of termination (how authors can retrieve their copyrights despite having signed contracts indicating that they have sold all rights).  The course also examines some state rights, such as the 'right of publicity' and 'quasi-property rights against the misappropriation of data', for purposes of exploring how these state doctrines interact with, or are pre-empted by, federal copyright law.   "LAW,JD 953,International Intellectual Property (S)," International law is increasingly important to domestic lawyers every day. This is as true in intellectual property as in any field. Regulation of intellectual property is a cornerstone in the globalization of trade and commerce. In order to harmonize intellectual property laws, more and more countries sign up to multilateral agreements regulating these laws. However, jurisdictional differences still exist and affect this process. This seminar examines international agreements and comparative laws on intellectual property and ways in which the intellectual property laws of the United States relate to those of other nations. Topics will include securing and enforcing rights in trademarks, copyrights and patents under international regimes and in various jurisdictions, and selected topics such as database protection, geographical indications, the interplay between intellectual property, international trade and culture, and Internet-related issues.   The seminar is designed to afford students who intend to practice in IP an acquaintance with key international IP principles and policy issues. The seminar will impart understanding in these areas using materials such as treaties, cases and commentary. The seminar will treat international and European intellectual property separately, and will focus on the major international systems related to each substantive IP area. The seminar is open to students who have completed or are enrolled in an IP survey course, or to LLMs with some intellectual property experience.

"LAW,JD 958,Effective & Ethical Depositions (S),"The purpose of this seminar is to teach students how to take and defend effective and ethical depositions.  The course involves both a simulated deposition component and a professional responsibility component.  The seminar also satisfies the professional responsibility requirement.  Simulated Deposition Course Component  Students will be divided into firms representing either the Plaintiff or the Defendants in a gender discrimination and defamation case brought by an attorney who has been denied partnership.  The students will prepare and perform depositions of lay and expert witnesses and gather experience with obtaining and developing facts, preserving testimony, and the uses of depositions.  Professional Responsibility Course Component  The simulated context offers the opportunity to explore several professional responsibility issues that arise naturally in deposition practice.  These issues emerge largely because of the dual professional roles of an attorney  zealous representative and officer of the court.  Some of the more timely issues involve proper witness preparation, improper witness coaching, inadvertent waiver of privilege, and abusive tactics.  Writing and Performance Requirements"LAW,JD 959,International Business Agreements,"Negotiating, Structuring and Drafting (S) This seminar will provide an overview of the private dimensions of negotiating and drafting international business agreements, and specifically on the contractual aspects. Students will gain hands on experience in structuring, drafting and analyzing various international business agreements and documents including global joint venture agreements and privatization provisions, sales, distribution and franchise agreements, international development agreements, share purchase agreements, letters of intent and technology licensing agreements.   The design of the class will assist students in identifying critical legal issues and techniques likely to affect the outcome of international business negotiations including protecting against political, economic and legal risks. Emphasis will be placed on the important differences between international and domestic agreements from the American law perspective. Grades will be based on class participation and a final research paper.  At the option of the student a final examination can be taken in lieu of a research paper.  NOTE  This seminar satisfies the Upper-class Professional Skills requirement.

"LAW,JD 962,Forensic Mental Health Issues for Lawyers (S),"Attorneys routinely deal with forensic mental health issues in the practice of criminal, tort, juvenile delinquency, child protection, civil rights, disability, employment and family law.  Familiarity with the law alone is rarely adequate for effective advocacy in these areas of law when mental health issues arise.

"LAW,JD 972,Lawyering in the 21st Century (S),"The practice of law has changed dramatically in the last several decades and is expected to change even more in the not-too-distant future.  Developments in global commerce and information technology are at the forefront of this change.  The globalization of commerce has resulted in the globalization of law practice, making the regulation of lawyers more difficult and less predictable.  Changes in lawyer regulation elsewhere in the world, such as the radical reforms recently enacted in the UK and in Australia (permitting the ownership of law firms by nonlawyers, including public investment, as well as the formation of multidisciplinary practices), are bound to have important implications for US lawyers.  Even for lawyers whose practices remain primarily local, developments in information technology have resulted in new challenges, such as 1) storing and protecting the confidentiality of electronic files; 2) regulating the quality of work outsourced to cheaper providers, including foreign lawyers; 3) regulating the provision of legal services through the internet; and 4) special issues concerning marketing and confidentiality that arise from the extensive use of social network sites.  This seminar will explore the ethical issues raised by these changes in the practice of law, including issues concerning unauthorized practice of law, conflicts of interest, confidentiality, advertising and solicitation. A substantial research paper will be required. There are no prerequisites for this seminar. This seminar satisfies the upper-class professional responsibility requirement.

It will only casually address issues in other jurisdictions- transfer pricing rules in strongly OECD jurisdictions like Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia will be considered only in a contrasting manner to provide context.  In addition, the transfer pricing rules in customs and those in the VAT (EU and elsewhere) will similarly be considered only where they provide contrast to the US rules.      "LAW,TX 953,Inbound International Taxation,"This course will cover the U.S. tax rules applicable to taxation of income from U.S. (and sometimes foreign) sources received by corporations and individuals that are non-residents of the United States. In some cases, such income will be derived from passive investments and be in the form of dividends, interest, rents, or royalties. In other cases, the income will arise from active business activities. The course will address the concept of residence and entity classification, the U.S. source of income rules, the U.S. withholding tax rules (including the obligations of withholding agents) with respect to non-business income, the types of activities that can generate a ""trade or business"" (tax nexus) in the U.S., the U.S. rules for determining income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business and thus taxable in the U.S., the branch profits tax, FIRPTA (foreign investment in U.S. real property) and the U.S. rules applicable to financing U.S. operations owned by non-U.S. taxpayers Finally, we will address the impact of tax treaties on the taxation of income of non-residents. This course will be of interest to students who will represent foreign resident taxpayers with economic operations in the United States.    "LAW,TX 955,Taxation of Intellectual Property,"Intellectual property- from sophisticated aerospace technology to computer software and web applications to music and video rights- is one of the most important, challenging, and sophisticated areas of modern commerce. However, because the IP revolution has occurred in only the last 25 years, many of the traditional principles of income taxation are not easily applied to IP assets. This course will explore the tax aspects of creating intellectual property, buying intellectual property, exploiting IP through leases and licenses, and strategies for selling valuable IP rights with the best tax results. The course will also explore important international tax issues, including the so called ""migration"" of IP offshore, cost-sharing arrangements, and other mechanisms that seek to ""locate"" IP and the associated tax liabilities in tax-favorable jurisdictions. The course will teach the tax differences between copyrighting and patenting a software program, the right and wrong ways to license and sell a trademark, and the mechanisms for turning a ""license"" into a ""sale"" and thereby converting ordinary income into capitol gains.     "LAW,TX 958,International Estate Planning,"The course will cover international estate planning from two perspectives (1) U.S. citizens residing outside of the U.S. or owning assets located outside of the U.S.; and (2) foreign citizens residing in the U.S. or transferring assets in or to the U.S. U.S. gift and estate tax laws applicable to both situations will be studied in depth in a practice-oriented manner. Planning techniques and vehicles utilized in international estate planning will be explored, in particular trusts and the special U.S. income tax rules applicable to foreign trusts with U.S. beneficiaries and off-shore U.S.-grantor trusts. The impact of non-U.S. transfer taxes and tax treaties will be considered, as well as non-tax foreign laws impacting on international estate planning. The course will also cover the U.S. tax and estate planning issues applicable to ""mixed marriages"" where one spouse is a U.S. citizen and the other is a non-U.S. citizen, and multi-jurisdiction situations of gifts or bequests from non-U.S. donors or decedents to U.S. beneficiaries. Finally, the course will also consider cultural and ethical issues peculiar to the area of international estate planning.  Prerequisite or corequisite Estate and Gift Tax, Estate Planning    "LAW,TX 959,Making Tax Law,"The course explores how U.S. tax law is made in order to provide context and perspective for interpreting the various provisions of the tax law.  It examines how considerations of tax policy, tax politics and tax administration contribute to the development of law through the legislative process, the promulgation of regulations and other administrative guidance, and the negotiation and ratification of tax treaties, as well as interactions and judicial evaluations of all of the above.  In other words, the course explores what happens on the road to tax law and what causes those twists and turns.  It necessarily discusses issues of tax policy, but the principal focus is on process.  We will use traditional cases, legislative documents, and other materials.  Pre or corequisite None   "LAW,TX 961,Fed Income Tax,"Cannot provide class description."LAW,TX 963,Corporate Tax,"Cannot provide class description."LAW,TX 966,Tax Practice,"Cannot provide class description."LAW,TX 968,Tax and Technology,"This course examines the convergence of technology solutions, in support of taxation, from two different angles corporations and government. On one hand, corporations use technology applied to the many areas of tax, to increase efficiencies and reduce error rates caused by manual processes. In doing so, they reduce risk, audit exposure and potential bad publicity, as they want to display good corporate citizenship. On the other hand, governments in general and tax authorities in particular are using IT (Information Technology) structures and relational databases quite widely to set up processes and procedures to encourage compliance, including taxpayer assistance; as well as data processing, audit selection, enforcement and fraud detection. The course will also compare and contrast these movements in America with other countries, as US-headquartered companies expanding abroad face new realities, unfamiliar tax structures and increasingly complex regulatory environments; and legal and tax professionals must be prepared for these challenges. Rather than focus on technology per se, analyzing computer programming language and codes, the bias of this course is the real-life business perspective of technology when applied to taxation and fiscal policy.   "LAW,TX 974,Gratuitous Transfer Taxation,"An analysis of the gift, estate and generation skipping transfer taxes and the income tax treatment of gifts and bequests using the problem method. Coverage of the fundamental principles underlying the income taxes and the transfer taxes and then how these principles have been codified in the Internal Revenue Code.

"LAW,XB 819,International Arbitration,"The old maxim ""where business goes, disputes soon follow"" has renewed vitality in an age of globalization.  As cross-border commerce follows American business abroad, and offshore foreign investment flows into the U.S., the potential for clashes in the business expectations of the parties increases, particularly as the economy softens.  Dispute resolution thus becomes an almost inescapable component of today's private international commercial dispute process.  The focus of the course will be on international arbitration, from inception in the contractual drafting through the mechanics of the dispute resolution process to the enforcement stage, with some consideration of other alternative dispute resolution techniques.  The original case studies and related materials are largely drawn from actual practice.  This course is designed for corporate attorneys as well as litigators.

Our guest speakers are prominent practitioners, experts and academics who provide an engaging and enriching pedagogical and networking experience for our students. A select number of spots are typically opened to LL.M. students in Boston University's American Law, Graduate Tax, or Banking Law programs.    "LAW,XB 822,Managing Compliance Risks for International Business Networks,"Extraterritorial application of US laws -- particularly in the areas of anti-corruption and sanctions -- has exposed multinational businesses and their networks of foreign subsidiaries, agents and collaborators to heightened risk of civil and criminal liability. High-profile prosecutions and fines have underscored the potential cost of non-compliance and the need for enhanced due diligence and monitoring of international business relationships. This course examines recent developments in US law that impact compliance risks in international business operations, and explores potential tools for evaluating and managing those risks.    "LAW,XB 823,Deals,"The Legal Engineering Behind Corporate Transactions This course looks at how lawyers can, and do, add value to complex transactions and contracts, or deals.

This  perspective has been hard-won, through persistent questioning, observation and creative thinking, and  its historical development parallels the development of the process of science. It has also led to our  present efforts to understand the origin and evolution of life as well as the future of our planet and the  very existence of humanity. Since the 1970's, we have been enjoying a remarkable period of solar  system exploration. We have landed on and flown by worlds both nearby and far away allowing us to  download maps of other solar system objects onto our hand-held devices. With new, larger telescopes,  we have discovered new planetary systems, new classes of objects in our solar system and even revised  the definition of the word planet.

"MET,CJ 601,History of Criminal Justice," This course examines the evolution of the criminal justice system in America, emphasizing the period from  the 18th century to contemporary forms of social control. An appreciation of the historical antecedents of  crime and justice will deepen students' understanding of the modern-day institutions of law enforcement,  courts, and corrections.    "MET,CJ 602,Criminology,"This course explores potential answers to complex and important questions about criminal behavior by  drawing on the social science of criminology.  Criminology is the interdisciplinary study of the  development of law, criminal phenomena and societal responses to crime.  The primary emphasis of  this course will be discussing and evaluating major explanations or theories of crime.  Because  criminology is interdisciplinary, we will examine theories that are ground in a range of academic  perspectives, including sociological, biological, political, psychological and economic explanations for  crime.  Course lectures and discussions focus on the historical development of the theories, their major  assumptions and propositions, their relevance for public policy and practice. As we progress through  each explanation for crime, we critically evaluate the validity of different explanations for crime as well  as criminal justice policies and practices that they support.    "MET,CJ 610,Special Topics in Criminal Justice,"Cybercrime This course is designed to help students understand and apply the nature of computer crime in the  criminal justice field. Several theories (both micro-level and macro-level) will be presented and will be  analyzed in depth and applied to computer crime cases both past and present. Students will see how  major theories have been re-developed to be applied to computer crime, and by using these theories,  students will both develop and explore different strategies for future law enforcement. Students will be  presented with common types of fraudulent schemes, as well as several laws that have been enacted  and developed specifically for computer crime. In addition, causes, victimization, legal issues, control  strategies, and societal costs regarding the ""computer-crime"" problem will be explored and evaluated.    "MET,CJ 625,Victimology,"The purpose of this course is to introduce the student to the discipline of victimology, an emerging area of specialization in the field of criminology.

The course focuses on traditions (literary, cinematic, and so forth) to emphasize genre and cultural history, and, as one of its goals, moves toward discussions of aesthetics. The course will examine the timeless quality of any work we consider a ""classic"" and also challenge the idea of timelessness by thinking about dialogues that exist between centuries and cultures and art. Contemporary examples will allow students to think of how other voices and perspectives (gender, ethnic, racial) may question the stability of what we often deem enduring or artistic. The course pushes beyond a simple comparison/contrast approach and mere discussions of influence. Instead, we will think through the implications (theoretical, political and aesthetic) of revision, adaptation, and the intertextual. Finally, the class asks students to formulate their own aesthetic criteria through a close reading of both primary texts and secondary critical essays which will supplement the readings, film screenings, and artwork.   "MET,IS 350,"Nature and the Divine in Myth, Literature, and Art","Over time and throughout cultures, human understanding of a divine presence, of a god or gods, has been intimately connected to our relationship with nature. In some myths, the divine is thought to be inherent in the forces of nature; in others, God stands outside, controlling nature and passing that control to human beings. Still another world view suggests that humans, nature, and the divine are all one thing, as represented in metaphors such as the circle or web of life. This course introduces students to some of the world's mythic traditions, applying them to the enduring cultural issues surrounding humanity's relationship to nature and our role as stewards of the environment. We will follow a roughly chronological syllabus, with readings from the Bible and classical mythology through the writings of Emerson and modern works such as Ceremony by Pueblo author Leslie Marmon Silko.

[Var cr.]      "MET,IS 419,American Traditional Music,"Traditional American music is a dynamic cultural medium that defines identity and community. It is transmitted by long-practiced modes of observation and imitation, and it engages talented musicians who are part of a long-lived cultural continuum. It is based upon a collective understanding of what tradition is, but it is necessarily altered in each generation as new musicians bring their training, insights, talents, and instruments to the process. The result- never entirely harmonious, always uneasy- holds a continuing power to speak to adherents and new listeners alike. It is not merely the tune that us transmitted in the traditional process, but also a portion of the social fabric that bound the tune as it was played in the past. How traditional music has evolved into the current popular American musical forms, and the history of the creation of a hybrid, but distinctively national, music will be explored in lectures, musical examples, and readings from some of the leading scholars of American traditional music.    "MET,IS 420,The Moral Self,"Psychological, Religious, and Spiritual Perspectives This course will examine morality through three related yet different lenses psychology, religion and spirituality. With war, terrorism, global climate change, geological disruptions, and other threats, humans tend to feel more vulnerable, more insecure, and to seek deeper understandings of themselves and their world. Accordingly, issues such as abortion, capital punishment, and stem-cell research take on new meanings as morality evolves with culture. How do we develop a moral understanding of what is appropriate behavior for ourselves and others around us? Is morality carved in stone or is it subject to change, depending upon life experience, religion, secular and social orientation, and other factors? The goal of this course is not to definitively answer questions but to generate them; not to agree on moral issues, but to facilitate understanding of others views; not to criticize, but to comprehend the strengths and limitations of each paradigm.   "MET,IS 421,The Art of Rhetoric in Life and Work,"The art of rhetoric is one of the original liberal arts and is a part of the trivium that includes grammar and logic.

This course is a study of the art of rhetoric in everyday life and work from both theoretical and practical perspectives with an emphasis on writing and interpretation.    "MET,IS 423,The Experience of Forgiveness,"Psychological, Sociological and Spiritual Perspectives This seminar explores the psycho/social/spiritual dimensions of the individual?s experience of forgiveness. The forgiveness process is investigated through the theoretical work of psychologists such as Carl Jung and Robert Enright and spiritual/political leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr., the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu. Individual narratives by forgivers are considered and analyzed in relation to the frames provided by these researchers and political activists. Through readings, journals and group presentations, students will explore both the beneficial and problematic aspects of forgiving. Students will develop a warranted, personal position on forgiveness and its limitations in personal and social life.   "MET,IS 450,Botany without Borders,"Online offering. Introduces students to practical problems in botany with a dual emphasis on plant evolution and plants in human affairs. The course crosses borders in time and geography as we examine the broad sweep of plants and their role on Earth over the past 300 million years. Plant form and function, evolution of seed plants, plant ecology, ethnobotany (human uses of plants), endangered plant communities, and prospects for conserving plant biodiversity are highlighted in this interdisciplinary course designed for undergraduates. While its focus is rigorously scientific, the course incorporates topics in the humanities (for example visual arts), and social sciences (anthropology) to illustrate the close relationship between humans and plants.  Fur further information, call the Office of Distance Education at 617-358-1960.    "MET,IS 460,Romanticism and Its Off-Shoots,"Countering the Enlightenment in Philosophical Literature and the Visual Arts This course explores various currents, paradoxes, and extensions of Romanticism, especially as this movement took shape in Europe and America, with a special focus on philosophical literature and the visual arts. We will begin with some central ideas and themes of German Romantic thinkers, exploring how these ideas and themes are also evoked by British and American writers as well as by European and American painters. We will identify and analyze Romantic themes and styles in early German expressionist films, in British gothic fantasy movies, and in American motion pictures about western frontier heroes. In the concluding part of the course, we will study twentieth-century extension or ?offshoots? of Romanticism, such as existentialism, depth-psychology, and the philosophy of nature. (4 cr.)   "MET,IS 470,Biblical Archaeology,"Methods, Theories, Contexts This course is designed to examine important archaeological discoveries relating to the Bible.

The course will cover the geography and topography of Palestine and the ancient Near East, and archaeological field methods used in Israel and Palestine. The history of writing and significant manuscript discoveries, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, will also be examined. Throughout the course, students will examine how archaeologists, looters, forgers, journalists, and theologians fight each other for the opportunity to discover, interpret, and sensationalize artifacts for the religious and irreligious alike. As we examine the archaeological artifacts, students will situate them in terms of their interpretation in documentary films, recent book publications, and other modern media.  "MET,IS 480,Physics of Motion,"Something in the Way it Moves Mechanics is the study of the motion of objects and the forces acting on objects. It is hoped that the student will share some of the excitement felt by great scientists such as Galileo and Newton when they discovered many of the principles on which the physics of motion are based. The course assumes that the student has a working knowledge of algebra, but the emphasis will be on a conceptual understanding of physics rather than on advanced mathematics.

After the French Revolution, French cuisine became a truly modern affair in the public sphere.  The invention of the restaurant, the practice of gastronomy, a literature of food, and strong links between French cuisine and national identity all came together in the 19th century.

Students will learn how to leverage marketing tools and emerging technologies in  the creation (e.g., customer insight, product and service design, branding),  delivery (e.g., communication and distribution), and capture (e.g., pricing,  customer life time value) of marketplace value. Across business contexts  including B2C, B2B, products versus services, global versus domestic markets,  small/medium/large organizations, for-profit versus social enterprises, the  course builds the fundamental skills involved in analyzing market challenges and  opportunities and making decisions for the formulation and implementation of  successful and sustainable marketing programs.    "GSM,MK 841,Customer-Driven Growth Strategies," Because companies face constant pressure to develop markets -- both existing and  new -- to feed demands for growth, we propose a course that would equip MBA  students with a nimble yet robust approach to identify, quantify and leverage  opportunities that facilitate growth. This course proposal comprises  experiential ""modules"" that are based on real-world scenarios designed in  collaboration with corporate executive partners (e.g., BU alumni, recruiters,  major area employers, network contacts). Modules pose growth challenges partners  have experienced in the sectors of (1) healthcare and pharmaceuticals, (2)  digital, (3) retail and (4) consumer-packaged goods.    "GSM,MK 845,Social Media Marketing," Social media technologies are continuously transforming the ways consumers  interact with each other and firms. These changes constitute a fundamental shift  in the marketplace--consumers have greater opportunities to voice their opinions  and connect with other consumers as well as increased influence over marketers  and brands. In this course, we examine how organizations capitalize on social  media and these consumer-to-consumer interactions to support their marketing  efforts. Specifically, we'll examine (a) how social media can be used to listen  to consumers and monitor their behavior; (b) developing and delivering content  that engages consumers; and (c) how to track the effectiveness of these efforts.  Finally, we'll explore how to manage both the internal and external dimensions  of social media engagement. We view these issues from a strategic and a  practical perspective, rather than a technical or platform perspective.  We  examine these topics using a hands-on approach, including live cases, personal  engagement in social media, and a team project.    "GSM,MK 849,Debiasing Decision Making," The objective of this course is to inform future managers, consultants, and advisors of the psychological processes and biases underlying the decisions made by customers, competitors, colleagues, and themselves, with emphasis on how to incorporate such insights into marketing and business strategies.  Applications of these processes and biases will be examined within the domains of the sustainability and health sectors.  The course will provide students with a broad overview of important results from various behavioral sciences (e.g., behavioral decision research, cognitive and social psychology, behavioral economics, consumer research) that demonstrate the several biases that can affect the quality of our strategic decisions. It is intended to provide students with knowledge about applying these findings to topics in marketing, strategic management, and organizational behavior.

"GSM,MK 860,Integrated Marketing Communication," The purpose of Marketing 860, Integrated Marketing Communication, is to help  students understand the evolution in marketing and communication that is being  created by the shift of technology in new and traditional media.  By becoming  less functionally-driven and more consumer-focused, marketing leaders will begin  to see that 'integration' is more than having a consistent 'look' across all  media platforms and better understand how to develop opportunities via targeted  strategies that align with both customer expectations and business objectives.  This course will focus on IMC - where it's been, where it's going and current  challenges to IMC, including internal functional silos, and traditional  marketing and advertising strategies.  In addition, the class will review the  various new mediums that continue to push marketing communications past  traditional thinking and structures putting it all in perspective through a  course project that will challenge students to put all of these learnings into  perspective.    "GSM,MK 862,Marketing High-Tech Products," This course provides you with a good understanding of how marketing works in a  high-tech context. When it comes to marketing, there are five important  characteristics that make high-tech offerings (products and services) special  technological uncertainty, customer uncertainty, competitor volatility, high- tech offerings are often used not singly but in larger overall systems, and  high-tech offerings often exhibit network externalities. These five  characteristics have a big impact on the type of challenges, analysis, and  marketing decisions made in high-tech industries. The overall purpose of this  course is to impart concepts, tools, and frameworks that you can apply as you  pursue careers as marketers of high-tech offerings, consultants, investment  bankers, and service professionals.

"GSM,MK 867,Marketing Social Change," Globalization, increasing transparency in business operations and the prevalence  of social media have forever changed the way stakeholders view and interact with  organizations.  Societal and business imperatives are not only often considered  compatible; they can be increasingly viewed as one and the same. People today  often communicate, organize and engage based on mutual interests, and,  generally, place  greater trust in organizations and individuals that work for a  better world. Marketing has often been referred to as the ""science of sales.""  Whether you are selling a product, an intervention or an idea, it can be a  powerful tool for advancing social change in today's dynamic environment. The  strategic integration of a relevant social purpose into a product, business or  nonprofit organization through brand-building citizenship activities can drive  consumer and donor recall, consideration, acquisition, retention and propensity  to recommend. However, these efforts do not usually constitute a ""silver bullet""  and may not be the best solution to a business problem or societal need at all.  In the worst cases, ill-conceived citizenship marketing strategies can result in  damaging consequences.  Practitioners must be pragmatic when engaging in  marketing social change. Understanding how to apply best practice, identify  opportunities, address challenges, engage stakeholders and innovate  strategically are essential skills in this rapidly evolving sector. The purpose  of this course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of how  marketing principles can be applied to create both short-term and lasting social  change. Students will explore dimensions of the modern landscapes of brand,  corporate and nonprofit ""citizenship"" and how they relate to marketing. Areas of  study include cause-related marketing and cause branding; nonprofit branding  and social movements, as well as corporate social responsibility and shared  value creation.   "GSM,MK 915,Consumer Behavior II,"   Because firms that excel in developing deep insight into consumer behavior create and capture more value in the marketplace, it is critical for researchers to establish a strong foundation in consumer research.  The present course serves as a companion to the MK914 Seminar in Consumer Behavior I, and considers what some have called ?The Cultural Interpretivist Turn? in Marketing. This perspective calls for a broader conceptualization of the discipline, with greater attention to - phenomena and dynamics at the socio-cultural level, under-leveraged theoretical perspectives beyond psychology and economics, and grounded methodologies capable of situating consumer behavior in the context of people?s lives.  Topics include but are not limited to Myth and Cultural Narratives; Semiotics; Materialism; Consumer-Brand Relationships; Consumer Socialization; Sub-Cultures of Gender, Lifestyle, Ethnicity, and Social Class; Communities and Tribes; Illicit Pleasures, Addictions, and High Risk Consumption; Politics of Consumption; and Consumer Well-Being.   "GSM,MK 927,Marketing Management and the Customer-Focused Firm,"This course will familiarize doctoral students with various areas of investigation for problem-oriented academic marketing research pertinent to the research mission of the department advancing the customer-focused firm.

"GSM,OB 712,Leading Organizations and People,"This course introduces you to some fundamental concepts, models and frameworks  to help you become better acquainted with the organizations for which you work,  the teams in which you work, the people with whom you work, and your own  personal development. Specifically, this course considers 1) how to develop  yourselves as managers, 2) how to work well within teams, 3) how to assess and manage interpersonal dynamics, 4) how to structure more  effective organizations, and 5) how to manage organizational change. Tying all  of these elements together, we will devote particular attention to the traits,  skills and behaviors that are indicative of good leadership and how  organizations and managers can be transformed for better alignment with the  business demands of the future.   "GSM,OB 713,Leading Organizations and People," This course introduces concepts, models and frameworks to help you become better  managers of the organizations you work for, the teams you work in, the people  you work with and your own professional development. Emphasis will be on  behavioral science concepts and research findings related to the major challenge  managers face -- how to organize individuals in order to fulfill the objectives  and strategies of the firm. Topics that will be examined include the nature and  dynamics of the organization (organizational structure and culture, performance  systems and metrics, reward systems, selection and socialization); the elements  of individual leadership and personal development (power, decision-making,  emotional intelligence, career development, developmental needs, feedback, and  mentoring and coaching); managing change within organizational contexts (the  dynamics and stages of organizational change and the skills and tactics employed  by change agents); and the relationships between the firm and the external  environment in which it operates. The course objective is to provide analytical  skills and strategies, substantive knowledge, and a professional sensibility  that will increase your ability to take effective action.   "GSM,OB 815,Career Management & Work-Life Integration," This seminar will examine major theoretical models and research on the process  of how careers unfold in and out of organizations. It will examine both the more  traditional issues of career dynamics in organizational settings (e.g., internal  labor markets, tournament mobility systems, organizational socialization) as  well as emergent issues of boundary-less, protean, or ""free agent"" career  processes, such as career transformation, career networks, developmental  relationships, adult development, and emotional competencies.     "GSM,OB 830,Leading the Mission-Driven Organization,"Mission-driven organizations are created in order to accomplish goals that  extend beyond profits for stakeholders and owners. Missions vary, ranging from,  among many others, improving health care, providing meaningful work  opportunities, educating or protecting youth, safeguarding the planet,  eradicating poverty, building sustainable organizations, and enabling  spirituality. Such missions occur in the context of various organizations,  including non-profit and for-profit, philanthropic and religious, public and  private, governmental and non-governmental. This course focuses on leadership  theories, frameworks, and practices that take seriously the nature of workers,  including both professional staff and volunteers, and their reasons for choosing  to work in such organizations. This course is designed to build the capacities  of students to use specific tools related to leadership, conflict, and change  that are particularly useful in leading mission-driven organizations, and enable  them to develop particular insights about specific mission-driven organizations  of interest, related to their effectiveness and capacities for change.    "GSM,OB 835,Leading Sustainable Enterprises,"This course is designed to deepen students' appreciation for the leadership challenges and opportunities posed by the emerging realities of a more crowded, interconnected, and increasingly resource constrained globe - a world of unprecedented transparency, increasing consumer and investor power and more NGO (non governmental organizations) oversight than ever before.  Independent of rank within a company, it is certain that managers, leaders and entrepreneurs will meet or be met with issues that were not a part of management lexicon a decade ago.  More specifically, pressures to deliver bottom line results are now compounded by challenges of how such results are delivered.  In order to achieve excellence, managers and leaders of tomorrow must be attuned to the traditional strategic framework for competition, and the context of the ecosystem in which they operate.  Leaders of tomorrow will compete consciously and generatively to improve the lives of stakeholders including shareholders, consumers, employees, suppliers and the planet.  This course will leverage systems thinking, case studies, debate, discussion, a blog and outside speakers from the world of commerce (e.g. the former CEO of Timberland, founder of QUINN Popcorn) and NGOs (e.g. EDF, TruCost, 1% for the Planet).  The course will blend theory and practice to provide students the context, tools, and frameworks to operate as sustainable stewards and leaders in the global economy.     "GSM,OB 840,Management Consulting Field Project,"The purpose of this course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding  of the management consulting process and its practical application.

This course requires a series of  interim deliverables contributing toward the final deliverable. This course is  primarily a field-based course supported by lectures, readings, guest speakers  and case discussions.  The course simulates a small consulting firm where you  are the consultant.  By working on a consulting assignment with team members as  well as using your classmates as resources for your project you are gaining the  ""real world"" experience of working in a small consulting firm.  This class is  designed and best suited for second year students who have 3-5 years work  experience in the public, private or nonprofit sectors. Management consulting  experience is not required though it is helpful.    "GSM,OB 841,Fundamentals of Nonprofit Management," The purpose of this course is to teach students about the distinctive challenges  of managing high-performing organizations in the nonprofit sector. The course  will cover a broad range of topics and it is intended to be a gateway course to  the sector and to potential electives and pathways of future learning. The two  major projects in the semester (one is individual, one in a team) offer students  the chance to choose an area of interest to explore in depth. Other assignments  challenge students to identify and analyze key indicators of nonprofit  performance and to communicate effectively about those issues to selected  stakeholders. A strong grounding in nonprofit accounting and financial  management is extremely valuable and so we devote considerable attention to  those topics. The course also addresses nonprofit marketing, evaluation,  fundraising and revenue generation, growth strategy, impact investing, and the  confluence of charity and commerce. The course is oriented to practice and will  engage experts in the field.    "GSM,OB 844,Managing Organizational Change," Change is crucial for the success and survival of organizations.  Managing  change is central to the role of senior leaders, middle managers, and frontline  supervisors alike; each needs to understand the change process and develop the  skills necessary to engage that process effectively.  This course focuses on  both the knowledge and the set of skills that enable change to be effectively  managed across various organizations and industries.  Students will learn how to  be effective agents of change, in the context of different types of roles--tops,  middles and bottoms--and organizations.  We will explore the nature of both  proactive and reactive change, examining the conditions under which such change  is successful and the skills necessary to ensure that success.  Students will  also have the opportunity to learn about themselves as change agents, in the  context of considering their own tendencies, skills, and capabilities amidst  proactive and reactive change.  The course is particularly appropriate for  students who wish to develop their leadership and consultation capabilities.    "GSM,OB 847,Leading High Performance Teams and Project Groups,"This course introduces the challenges of leading and participating in teams and project groups.  It emphasizes the role of leadership in composing teams, motivating members, and creating an environment in which teams and their members grow in capacity over time.  This course will use cases, experiential exercises, and group projects to help students gain both knowledge of team dynamics and the skills to shape them.    "GSM,OB 848,The Leadership Challenge," This course examines the essence of leadership; its relationship to managing; and the behaviors, attitudes and perspectives that distinguish leaders.  Leadership is considered in a variety of ways leadership in crises, at the top, in the middle, and in groups.  Case studies, students' past experiences, instruments, and other learning activities provide opportunities for students to assess and develop their leadership talents.   "GSM,OB 853,Negotiations," This course uses the theory and research on effective negotiating strategies to build students' understanding of, and skills for, managing differences and negotiation situations.  The course considers, among other topics, the issues of negotiating across functions, between levels, across national and cultural differences, over race and gender differences, and between organizations.  Students examine 1) problems of influence and self-defense in highly competitive ""hardball"" negotiations; and 2) the art of using differences for creative problem-solving and ""mutual gain"" outcomes.

"GSM,PL 870,"Government, Society and Sustainable Development"," Government, Society and Sustainable Development is a broad and far-reaching course in scope and topics. After an introduction to the concepts of the limits-to-growth and global sustainability challenges resulting from population growth, resource scarcity, environmental degradation and climate change students dive deep into the cultural, societal and economic development issues of globalization, study the implications of globalization on the current social and economic development of nations/regions/industries and explore new development models (for-profit and non-profit entrepreneurship) for sustainable development at the international, national, and sub-national levels.  The Course has three major themes  ? The first major theme of the course is a series of country cases that explore the cultural, social, political and economic context in which business enterprise has historically been conducted.    ? The second major theme of the course overlays the international institutions that emerged from Bretton Woods; the UN, GATT/WTO, the World Bank and the IMF, (the emerging World Environmental Organization, WEO) onto the country cases and explores emerging topics of international Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and International Environmental Protection (IEP).  ?

Corporate diversification and global management are important topics that are also featured.    "GSM,SI 814,Intellectual Property Strategies," This course covers the ways in which companies use intellectual property to  protect their investments in knowledge assets. Traditionally a concern for  technology-intensive businesses, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade  secrets have become important business tools throughout the knowledge-based  economy. A good understanding of what IP assets are and how they work has become  essential for managers in all types of organizations. This is not a law course,  nor a how-to manual rather it is intended to develop your analytical  understanding of fundamental economic and legal aspects of intellectual property  systems, and how they drive competition and strategy.    "GSM,SI 830,Corporate Strategies for Growth," This course will examine strategies for firm growth that involve expanding the range of the firm?s business activities.

"GSM,SI 836,Foundations of Environmental Sustainability," This course introduces students to the Social Enterprise and Environmental  Sustainability sector. Firm actions have increasingly broad and visible social  consequences; private, non-profit, and public leaders need to be able to respond  to the challenges and opportunities that these consequences impart. In this  course, we will discuss a broad set of contexts, including ""green"" products,  renewable energy, carbon markets, and worker health and safety, unified by their  creation or destruction of social value. This course provides students with an  understanding of how the tools and concepts of business apply to contexts of  significant social value, where there are often externalities generated by firm  actions that call forth regulation and public policy, NGO activism, and consumer  attention. It explores how the social and environmental impact of firm actions  can provide both challenges and opportunities for firms to create and capture  value.     "GSM,SI 839,Design and Innovation Strategy,"This class will examine how managers and leaders can create the conditions for innovation at the individual, team and organizational levels ? and how those conditions differ for startup and mature organizations. Managing innovation includes the generation of ideas; the integration of  ideas into new product concepts; and the commercialization of ideas. While core strategy courses address the questions of what innovations to pursue and whether and when those innovations will bring value, this course addresses the question of how managers can create organizations to deliver innovations of value. Thus, the course will focus on the practices and processes that mangers need to put in place to enable organizations to execute on an innovation strategy. In doing so, students will evaluate how to balance the challenges of organizing, managing and leading innovation with the need to produce concrete, routine and expected outcomes within the organization.  To be innovative, any new idea must resolve the innovation paradox ? introducing enough novelty to appeal to new markets while retaining enough familiarity to tap into existing behaviors. Because design and innovation are frequently inseparable in managing this paradox, the class will assess how design contributes to innovation in product, process and business models across industry sectors.  The course will also consider the role that all sources of innovation play ? including communities, networks, brokers and other forms of open innovation.  Students will be asked to reflect upon innovations that have been critical to their lives, and how these innovations were produced and gained market traction. Final group projects will explore how to ?rescue? innovations in trouble with turnaround teams.

It stresses fast approximate analysis to achieve managerial insights over precise calculation.     "GSM,SI 870,Strategies for Sustainable Development," Strategies for Sustainable Development is a broad and far-reaching course in  scope and topics. After an introduction to the concepts of the limits-  to- growth and global sustainability challenges resulting from population growth,    resource scarcity, environmental degradation and climate change students dive    deep into the cultural, societal and economic development issues of    globalization, study the implications of globalization on the current social and    economic development of nations/regions/industries and explore new development    models (for-profit and non-profit entrepreneurship) for sustainable development    at the international, national, and sub-national levels. The Course has three    major themes 1) The first major theme of the course is a series of country   cases  that explore the cultural, social, political and economic context in   which  business enterprise has historically been conducted. 2) The second major   theme of  the course overlays the international institutions that emerged from   Bretton  Woods; the UN, GATT/WTO, the World Bank and the IMF, (the emerging   World  Environmental Organization, WEO) onto the country cases and explores   emerging  topics of international Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), Corporate   Social  Responsibility (CSR) and International Environmental Protection (IEP).   3) The  third major theme of the course explores the emergence of new models of    sustainable development; contrasting bottoms-ups collective action and    entrepreneurship against classic aid-based models as a force for change and    driver of sustainable development.

Guidance will be provided in assessing critical commercialization milestones by a combination of faculty and mentors from the business community.    "GSM,SI 917,Research Seminar in Technology Strategy and Innovation,"This doctoral seminar serves as a survey course to the broad area of technology and innovation management.  We will review and critique a large and diverse body of literature that can be considered ""core"" to the field.  We will place emphasis on both classic theories and seminal contributions as well as on recent research that builds upon or extends the established theories. One key differentiator of this research seminar is that five professors actively doing research in the field will teach it. While having multiple instructors brings some coordination challenges (these are less critical in doctoral seminars than they are in masters level classes), it has one major advantage it allows each faculty to lead those sessions that deal with topics of her or his direct research expertise. Students can expect to cover each topic with researchers that have been important contributors to the intellectual debate in the topic they teach.  The seminar will cover key issues in the management of technology and innovation including innovation definitions and patterns (e.g. industry life cycle), entry timing strategies, platforms and standards, networks, dynamic capabilities, organizing for innovation, open and community-based innovation, licensing & patenting, technology diffusion, geography of innovation, and science and innovation policy. SI917 provides a solid base to critically explore many key topics of research in technology and innovation management. It is therefore aimed at doctoral students who plan to do research in technology and innovation management, or those who need a solid exposure to these topics to inform their research in related areas.

Methods are presented for the assessment and control of confounding, misclassification bias, and selection bias. Strengths and weaknesses of standardization, pooling, modeling, and exposure-response analysis are reviewed.     "SPH,EP 855,Advanced Epidemiology Seminar,"Issues in Study Design  This course is structured around reading and discussing both historical and current methodological papers.  The first section of the course focuses on papers by early theoreticians and methodologists. The second section focuses on contemporary methodologic questions.  Substantive areas may evolve and vary over time.  Recent topics have included case-control studies, study efficiency, measures of effect, exposure misclassification, sensitivity analysis, casual diagrams, and direct and indirect effects.    "SPH,EP 857,Design and Conduct of Cohort Studies," This is a third-level epidemiologic methods course intended for advanced Masters and Doctoral students who desire to build depth and nuance in their understanding of cohort study design and conduct.  The course will build on classic and state-of-the-art papers which focus in depth on various topics such as selection of appropriate measure of excess risk and intermediate endpoints (theory and practice).  For each topic, methodologic readings will be linked back to concrete examples of cohort study design, with special emphasis on practical aspects of study conduct.     "SPH,EP 858,Design and Conduct of Case-Control Studies," This course will develop students? practical knowledge of the design and conduct of case-control studies. It will cover the relationship between cohort and case-control studies and study design issues, including identification of a study base, selection of cases and controls, collection of exposure information, sources of bias, and matching. Published papers will be used to illustrate design, bias, and analytic issues through reading and discussion. Each class includes a lecture and discussion of assigned articles.    "SPH,EP 860,Novel Analytical Methods for Epidemiology," This course is intended to introduce doctoral students to a number of advanced methods in data analysis, with the aim of providing students with the ability to recognize situations in which the use of such methods may be beneficial, knowledge of the basic methods needed to conduct analyses, and an understanding of the strengths and limitations of each method. The course covers approximately five analytic methods in a series of 2- or 3-session modules. Topics may vary slightly in different semesters; examples of the types of methods covered include propensity scores, marginal structural models, quantitative bias analysis, and Bayesian analysis. Hands-on sessions in the classroom, homework assignments, and a final data analysis project provide students with practice in the conduct of analyses using these methods.    "SPH,EP 861,Quantitative Bias Analysis Methods for Epidemiologic Research," This course covers a novel approach to dealing with systematic error in epidemiologic research called quantitative bias analysis, QBA. QBA allows users to make corrections to measures of association for sources of bias by making assumptions typically using validation data about the nature of the bias to create intervals that account for total study error. The course will cover three types of bias analysis simple, multidimensional and probabilistic. Exercises in Excel and SAS will allow students to practice the methods, adapt them to problems they face and present the results clearly.   "SPH,EP 980,Continuing Study," PhD, DSc, and MS in Epidemiology students who have completed all academic course requirements, must register for Continuing Study every Fall and Spring semester until they have successfully defended their theses/dissertations and have graduated from SPH.

"SPH,IH 702,Skills in Critical Analysis and Evidence Based Writing for Public Health Professionals, This introductory course will develop students? abilities to read the public health literature critically and to integrate evidence into a well-crafted policy memo. The class will focus on critical analysis of a case study focused on two research articles analyzing interventions to prevent HIV transmission. Through in-class discussions students will explore why the studies drew different conclusions. Course assignments will allow students to hone the applied critical analysis and writing skills they will need as public health professionals.       SPH,IH 703,Global Public Health,"History, Approaches and Practices  If I have seen further it is only by standing on the shoulders of Giants. Sir Isaac Newton, 15 February 1676. As public health professionals, we stand on the shoulders of giants.  This course has two major goals to welcome students into membership in the professional social movement called public health and to expose them to the rich historical tradition of the profession. Using selected public health case studies, we will highlight a selection of extraordinary individuals and events with the goal of illuminating current global health architecture and building understanding of the politics of priority-setting and decision-making.  The course will address issues of human rights, individual rights, population rights and ethics.  "SPH,IH 704,Global Public Health and Medical Care,"A Systems Approach This course gives students an understanding of the elements common to all medical care systems and the factors which influence the shape, cost, performance, and quality of health systems. Examples are drawn from countries whose wealth and stage of development vary widely. The interaction between the public and private components of the health sector is explored. Equity in health services is a crosscutting theme. Students learn about the organization, delivery, and financing of medical care and the strengths and weaknesses of alternative approaches to health care finance and delivery. The major problems in health care facing low- and middle-income countries and the strategic options available to these countries are addressed. The course is taught in an interactive lecture format. There is an emphasis on systems thinking and systems approach. All Global Health concentrators, MPH students who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the U.S., and MI program students may take this class.  HPM concentrators must take PM702. Students who have taken PM702 for MPH degree credit may enroll in IH704 as an MPH elective. Global Health concentrators are given preference in registration but registration is open.    "SPH,IH 707,Kenya Field Practicum in Public Health and Environment," This 5-week course in Kenya focuses on environmental and community health as it relates to the indigenous Maasai residing at the base of Mount Kilimanjaro.  In the early 1980s Kenya began a process of privatizing open grazing land into group ranches. This significant land use change has forced traditionally nomadic peoples, including the Maasai, onto smaller plots of land.  This change in lifestyle has been associated with a rise in sanitation-related and water-borne diseases, infant and childhood disease and HIV/AIDS. Participants in the Kenya Field Practicum will be trained in field-based data collection, analysis, report-writing and presentation skills.  Past summer sessions have collected baseline information on water and sanitation practices, community health indicators and worked with local organizations to evaluate the success of health interventions.  Results and recommendations are presented to local Maasai leaders and other stakeholders.  Contact Joe Anzalone for information regarding application, travel, and related information.  The course also fulfills the BUSPH field practicum requirement if students also complete two skills-based professional development seminars.    "SPH,IH 708,Program for Global Health Practice in the Philippines/classroom," The Program in Global Health Practice (PIHP) in the Philippines is an intensive, twelve week field experience. To meet the requirements of SPH IH708, students attend a Parasitology Course at the University of the Philippines College of Public Health, comprised of field trips to participate in research projects and learn about schistosomiasis and malaria control programs in the Philippines.

Both BUSPH and AAU provide faculty oversight. IH711 is the practicum portion of this experience.     "SPH,IH 720,Social and Behavioral Sciences in Global Public Health,"Public health professionals know what behaviors contribute to health; however, they know less about why people fail to adopt healthy practices. This course is based on the premise that the more we understand about why people behave the way they do, the more successful we will be as we develop and implement programs and policies designed to improve health. This course uses psychology, sociology and anthropology to improve our understanding of the determinants of health behavior and will provide an introduction to a variety of health behavior theories and basic qualitative research methods. Our intent is to develop practical strategies for understanding the social and behavioral foundations of public health, enabling us to plan effective interventions. Working individually and in groups, students will use conceptual frameworks such as BEHAVE to help identify a public health problem, select a target audience, conduct basic qualitative research to determine facilitators and barriers to engaging in a given practice, and propose several behavior change and communications (BCC) strategies based on an assessment of the situation. IH720 meets the MPH core course requirement in social and behavioral sciences for Global Health concentrators and international, nonresident students who are not SB concentrators. Students may not take both IH720 and SB721 for MPH degree credit.     "SPH,IH 722,Supply Chain Management for Improved Health System Performance,"Supply chain logistics is an important aspect of public health programs, and an area that is often unappreciated.  The journey from manufacturer to a patient in a remote rural village in Africa is complicated and fascinating serious management challenge.  This course provides a practical introduction to the core tenets of health commodity supply chain management (SCM), including system design, assessment, quantification, procurement, inventory management, and logistics management information systems.  Using the ""Access Framework,"" students will gain foundational knowledge and apply that knowledge in class exercises, discussions, case studies, and stakeholder interactions.  Course assignments will have a strong experiential component with a focus on professional level communications and analytical skills.      "SPH,IH 735,"Gender, Sexuality, Power, & Inequity in Global Health"," This course explores the socio-cultural, economic and political contexts in which people live their lives and how these, and local and large-scale forces of structural violence (inequity, marginalization and gender discrimination) impact health and development. Course readings and discussions examine how these forces constitute immediate and fundamental risk factors and must therefore be considered and addressed as part of any effort to improve public health. Course format seminar with topics introduced by professor and guest lecturers.    "SPH,IH 741,Global Health Consultation Techniques,"This course will prepare students for consulting and technical assistance assignments in developing countries. Students learn to analyze the pros and cons of potential consulting assignments and prepare proposals. The potential conflicts between donors/sponsors and the agency receiving the consulting services will be considered. Assignments considered include financial analysis, operational improvements, training and program evaluation. Cross cultural issues and the problems of operating in remote areas are discussed. This course is for foreign nationals returning to their own countries and US citizens/residents who will seek international assignments with USAID contractors or NGOs. During this intensive one week course, students prepare a proposal in response to an actual RFP (Request for Proposal) as well as a presentation summarizing findings of a major consulting or research assignment.    "SPH,IH 743,Implementing Health Programs in Developing Countries,"Making Programs Work  As professionals working in low and middle income countries, we often end up running programs we did not design, which are under-financed, and which face enormous implementation challenges. In this course, students will work with a specifically identified health program that is currently being implemented and conduct systems analyses, undertake problem solving exercises, and propose solutions to real implementation challenges in the field. Ultimately they will be able to prioritize the interventions necessary to effectively run a complex health program in such diverse situations as urban slums and dispersed rural areas in developing countries and be prepared to plan the actions to effectively run those programs. This course is directed towards students in the health management emphasis area and is not suitable for students in their first semester of studies. Students who will particularly benefit from this course are foreign nationals returning to their own countries and U.S.citizens or residents who will provide technical assistance through NGOs or other agencies to implement existing health programs.   "SPH,IH 744,Program Design for Global Health," Developing a structured approach to program design is an important skill for public health professionals. IH744 provides an opportunity to learn and apply the key steps of program design. The course invites students to work with an international non-governmental organization to design a public health program. The non-governmental organization will orient student consultant teams with a scope of work that will contain guidelines for developing a program for the organization and identifying prospective donors for funding. To complete the scope of work, each team will identify and describe a relevant public health problem and apply evidenced based solutions to address the problem(s). Course work will also sharpen the knowledge and the skills required for working effectively in a team and students will learn to reflect on individual and team performance. Students will be introduced to e-portfolio and will use it to document their knowledge and skills in program design.    "SPH,IH 745,Monitoring and Evaluation of Global Health Programs," There is consensus within the global public health community that inadequate project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) represents a major constraint in programmatic efforts to address the problems we face. The absence of sound M&E processes in large numbers of public health projects, despite continued evidence of their value in assessing and improving project performance, suggests that many project planners and managers may not yet have the necessary skills or understanding to develop and operate such systems. This course is designed to help address this need. This course provides a detailed analysis of program monitoring and evaluation with an emphasis on public health and nutrition-related projects. By reading relevant literature and using case studies, students will gain an understanding of the language and tools of program evaluation. The course will focus both on theory and practical utilization, and will consist of presentations, discussions, and applied exercises involving the preparation and critiquing of monitoring and evaluation plans. The course has a required, non-credit lab that is scheduled in a different time slot than the class.     "SPH,IH 755,Managing Disasters and Complex Humanitarian Emergencies,"This course will provide students with a solid introductory understanding of disasters and complex emergencies and introduce practical responses and interventions. By the end of the course, students will be able to describe human and natural emergencies and their main causes, articulate and conduct public health assessments, prioritize needs, and plan immediate and long-term interventions. Class discussions will also focus on analyzing and anticipating the consequences of emergencies.    "SPH,IH 756,Analytical Methods for Pharmaceutical Systems Assessment," This course aims to develop skills essential to assessing and evaluating pharmaceutical policy and the performance of pharmaceutical programs. Students will learn to develop a pharmaceutical country profile, analyze medicine prices and availability, apply technical guidelines, and use other assessment tools and methods in the pharmaceutical sector. Students will also develop skills to undertake a sampling exercise, use qualitative methods, and review and write technical reports. Students will use instruments which are already developed with a focus on implementation issues, analysis of data collected and awareness of strength and limitation of each method applied. The course will introduce students to the many resources which exist to help understand pharmaceutical sectors, and prepare them to work in a national or sub national pharmaceutical system.    "SPH,IH 757,Fighting Corruption Through Accountability & Transparency,"Corruption and lack of accountability in government are concerns in all countries, but they are especially critical problems in developing and transitioning countries where public resources are already scarce and corruption can cripple growth and development. In international health work, most public health practitioners will encounter corruption at some point and will need to make ethical and management decisions about how to work within corrupt systems and how to prevent corruption from occurring. This course is designed to introduce participants to the problem of corruption and provide them with skills for assessing vulnerabilities to corruption in the health sector.  Topics covered include corruption risks in drug procurement and supply, medical conflicts of interest, informal payments, and financial corruption. Participants will acquire the confidence, knowledge, and skills needed to become effective advocates for anti-corruption strategies and health system reforms.     "SPH,IH 762,Essentials of Economics and Finance for Global Health,"This course is an introduction to the essential concepts and tools of health economics and financing with application to the particular challenges facing transitional and developing countries. The course does not assume prior training in economics and will provide an introduction to the conceptual underpinnings of health economics, highlighting those concepts that will be most useful in applied policy settings. Case studies will focus on practical application to current international health financing policy problems.    "SPH,IH 766,Reproductive & Sexual Health in Disaster Settings,"Of the millions of people displaced by armed conflict around the world, 65-80% are women and children. In recent armed conflicts, women have been the targets of exploitation, rape, forced marriage, forced pregnancy, and other types of gender-based violence. These violent acts have implications on women?s reproductive health. This course will expose students to the issues affecting the reproductive and sexual health of women in conflict and post-conflict situations. The context of recent conflicts and their effects on women?s health will be analyzed. Other topics will include common reproductive health morbidities in conflict situations, reproductive health assessments, programming, monitoring and evaluations, gender-based violence, and rape as a weapon of war. Specific examples will be drawn from the wars that occurred in former Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Southern Sudan, and the ongoing war in Darfur, Western Sudan.    "SPH,IH 770,"Poverty, Health, and Development"," Poverty, Health and Development is the core International Public Health course for master?s students in the new University-wide Global Development Policy Program. The course also serves as an elective course for students in public health. The goal of this course is for students to explore the relationships between poverty, health, and development in low-income countries. While not a methods course per se, methods in public health, economics, statistics, and quantitative impact evaluation will be introduced and used throughout the course.    "SPH,IH 773,Financial Management for Health Programs,"Health care managers must be prepared to talk about financial issues, analyze and interpret data, and make decisions using financial information.  This course develops competencies in cost analysis, pricing, budgeting, and reading financial reports in international health settings where financial systems are weak and data not easily available.  In addition to using principles of differential and full cost analysis, students gain skills in breakeven analysis and calculating mark-ups.  Examples are drawn from hospitals, clinics, and revolving drug funds from developing countries.      "SPH,IH 777,Global Health Culminating Experience Seminar," This seminar course has two main purposes first, to enable participants to respond to one another's work, examine issues in the writing process, make improvements from draft to draft, and complete a well-researched, well-argued concentration paper; second, to explore issues in global health that are the focus of their research and emerge with a greater understanding of the questions they raise for policy and practice. Papers go through three drafts, and students will have the opportunity to give and receive feedback in peer review sessions. Background readings and regular participation in class critiques and discussions are required. Students must be working on their culminating experience to be enrolled in the class.   "SPH,IH 781,Nutrition and Public Health in Lower Income Countries," This course introduces students to public health nutrition in the developing world. Topics include 1) the major nutritional challenges facing low-income countries (including macro- and micronutrient deficiencies, HIV and infant feeding, nutrition in emergencies and obesity) 2) nutrition through the life cycle 3) potential causes of poor nutrition including health behavior, societal norms, and economic factors 4) innovative approaches to addressing undernutrition 5) monitoring and evaluation efforts to track changes in nutritional status and feeding behaviors, and 6) policy-level responses to malnutrition, especially among women and children. While some class time is devoted to clinical nutrition, equal emphasis is placed on behavioral and programmatic issues including successful community-based nutrition interventions, national and international responses to under-nutrition and how these can be coordinated. This course also briefly reviews the evidence base for each approach. By the end of this course, students will be able to broadly describe the literature on international nutrition and to use Excel to clean and analyze data on infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices.     "SPH,IH 795,Global AIDS Epidemic,"Social & Economic Determinants, Impact, & Responses  AIDS is one of the most important pandemics and human development challenges of our time. This course explores the determinants and impacts of the AIDS pandemic and examines best practices in prevention, care and treatment and impact mitigation. Students will explore the relationship between human rights, gender and vulnerability to HIV; examine effective multi-sectoral responses; and evaluate the benefits and limitations of major multi- and bi-lateral AIDS initiatives. Students will also examine the major debates in the AIDS field and explore different, at times contradictory, perspectives.       "SPH,IH 800,Clinical development of a new medicinal,"A case study about licensing a new vaccine for the developing world  Vaccines are arguably our most potent public health tools. The clinical development of a new vaccine is a massive undertaking, spanning many years, and typically costing hundreds of millions of dollars  -- yet the process by which new vaccines are developed, tested, licensed, and used is poorly understood. In this course, students will participate in an extended simulation of the clinical development of a new vaccine.  Students will design a Phase I through Phase III clinical development program; at each step, decisions the students take will influence future events, making the course highly iterative and flexible.   The course is taught by an infectious disease specialist who recently led a clinical development team at Novartis Vaccines that led to licensure of a new meningococcal vaccine in over 33 countries.  This course requires a substantial amount of time working in groups outside of the scheduled class time.      "SPH,IH 804,mHealth," Located at the nexus of technology, informatics and public health, mHealth (defined as medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices, such as mobile phones, patient monitoring devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other wireless devices) is rapidly emerging from its pilot stage to become an important component of public health programs. In this course, you will learn how to design, develop, implement and evaluate a mHealth program. You will learn the basic terminology of mHealth programs, how to develop, design and evaluate a mHealth intervention as well as learn the current state of the field and major international mHealth implementers. Using a theoretical base, you will also learn the technical skills of developing an application based on a case study that can be deployed and used on a mobile phone.  This course is suited for students who are at least in their second semester and who are familiar or interested in learning more about how mobile technology intersects with the health sector.     "SPH,IH 805,Controversies in Global Control and Eradication of Infectious Diseases," This is an advanced level seminar course. It focuses on areas of active controversy regarding past and current eradication/control campaigns. This class will consider the biological, epidemiological, sociological, political, ethical, and programmatic features that allowed the smallpox eradication campaign to succeed. Other diseases that are currently candidates for global eradication campaigns that will be covered in this class include polio, measles, malaria, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and dracunculiasis. Public health policy decisions ultimately rest on basic and clinical scientific research. This course approaches this topic through a series of focused readings drawn from the primary scientific literature. The goal is to prepare students to better participate in these debates themselves.     "SPH,IH 808,Research Proposal Development,"A Practical Approach to Team Grant Writing  The main objective of this course is to equip students to develop a research project in a developing country. The scope of the proposal can include baseline data collection for needs assessment, monitoring and evaluation of an existing program, or identification of predictors associated with health or disease outcomes.  Students learn practical skills associated with writing a proposal including creating project objectives, sampling methods, calculating sample-size, developing a work plan and budgeting.  Students work in teams throughout the semester to develop the proposal.  Proposals from this class have successfully competed for funding.     "SPH,IH 811,Applied Research Methods in Global Health," The objective of this course is to teach student teams how to collect and analyze both quantitative and qualitative data to answer study questions.  Student teams will conduct a research study with multiple research methods including a cross-sectional survey and their choice from a variety of qualitative methods.  The scope of the research questions addressed will be limited to minimal risk research conducted with students on the Boston University Medical Campus in the space of a semester.  Each team will design a questionnaire, administer it, and enter and analyze the data using EpiInfo or other statistical software.  In conjunction with the cross-sectional survey, each team will also use some form of qualitative method, such as in-depth interviews or focus group discussions (FGD).  The student teams will integrate the results of the cross-sectional survey and the qualitative research and present a report with findings and recommendations to their peers and faculty members.  Students completing the course will have the skills to be able to collect and analyze data in a wide variety of settings.    "SPH,IH 820,Global Issues in Pharmaceutical Policy and Programming,"Pharmaceutical policies are changing rapidly in developing countries. Ensuring access, maintaining quality, and promoting rational drug use are the priorities. This course examines national drug policies, selection issues, medicine pricing and availability, financing, health insurance, donations, and the role of the private sector and approaches to improving drug use. The impact of global treaties and particularly the TRIPS agreement WTO and access to AIDS drugs will be addressed. The course will also examine the role of global and bilateral donor programs for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The course will utilize a seminar format and will require substantial reading to prepare for small group discussions and activities.      "SPH,IH 854,From Data to Dashboards,"Building Excel Skills to Support Health Program Decisions  In these uncertain times, managers need, more than ever, to make sound decisions based on data.  Good spreadsheet models are important tools in this process. Build your Excel ""toolbox"" by learning and applying robust formulas, graphing and dashboarding techniques, and data analysis in a wide range of real-world case study examples, such as cost and utilization analysis, estimation of revenues and expenses, and performance dashboards to monitor and evaluate performance of health interventions.  Students will have the opportunity to build their own models to apply to a health service challenge of their choosing. This course is appropriate for upper level MPH students who have basic excel skills.   "SPH,IH 880,Confronting non-communicable diseases in the developing world,"the burden, costs and health systems challenges  A combination of lower fertility rates and changing environmental factors and lifestyles has led to aging populations and epidemics of tobacco addiction, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes, and other chronic ailments, aggravating the persisting burden of infectious diseases in the developing world. This advanced course aims at providing a thorough understanding of the risk factors, epidemiology, burden, and economic consequences of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases and the fundamental policy considerations regarding intervention strategies for their prevention and control in resource constrained settings. This overall goal will be achieved by marrying economic approaches with those of epidemiology, clinical medicine and public health.   "SPH,IH 881,Program Design for Global Reproductive and Perinatal Health," This course addresses the major reproductive and perinatal health problems facing communities around the world. We will focus on current strategies to address human reproduction, maternal health and the health of newborns. For each problem, we will consider the fundamental causes and possible solutions, including what works, what does not work and what is being tried.  Topics will include maternal mortality, gender based violence, abortion, STIs, family planning and health of the newborn.    "SPH,IH 885,"Global Trade, Intellectual Property and Public Health"," On the broadest level, any person interested in international public health, needs to know about globalization and trade. Globalization rewards creative and technically skilled workers and places its largest pressures on lower-skilled workers. A specific example of globalization is that of India and their embrace of new intellectual property (IP) laws. The implementation of these IP and trade rules lies somewhere between outright opposition to reforming global IP rules and an unthinking acceptance that doing so will encourage biomedical innovation and improved health outcomes. The effects of stronger IP standards on health and innovation in medicines and diagnostics are ambiguous and thus need to be subjected to empirical analysis. This course will explore the complex and ambiguous relationship between global trade, intellectual property and its impact on public health.       "SPH,IH 887,Planning and Managing Maternal and Child Health Programs in Developing Countries,"This course provides a practical framework to enable students to design, manage, and evaluate services for children and women, with an emphasis on child health. The course covers the major health challenges with a focus on children and explores specific interventions to address these challenges. Topics covered include diarrheal disease, acute respiratory infection, immunization, malaria, micronutrient deficiencies, HIV/AIDS, safe motherhood and neonatal health. The final six weeks of the course will give students the opportunity to identify the technical, political, organizational, and environmental factors necessary for a successful program. Students will work in teams to respond to an RFP for improving the health of women, children, or newborns in a developing country. Teams will attend a bidder?s conference and then prepare and present a written and oral proposal to an outside grants committee. Students cannot take both IH744 and IH887 for MPH degree credit.    "SPH,IH 888,Seminar on Global Health Policy Issues," This seminar focuses on policy formulation related to public health problems in low- and middle-income countries and is intended for students who have some experience. How is policy formulated in different settings? Who sets the policy agenda? Why do some issues get the attention of policy-makers, while other equally important issues fail to gain traction? And what approaches can be used to improve the chances of a particular policy being adopted? Students will carry out a policy analysis on a policy issue of their choice, using the policy analysis approaches and tools presented in class.    "SPH,IH 943,Directed Study in Global Health for the Culminating Experience," Students who must complete a directed study for their Global Health Culminating Experience register for IH943 with their culminating experience advisor.  Students who select Option Two, the journal article, must register for a 2-credit directed study.  Other students may choose a 1-credit directed study if appropriate and approved by the Global Health Department.  Registration in IH943 is via a proposal form and an add/drop form. Registration is not online.     "SPH,IH 950,Culminating Experience in Global Health," Zero-credit option for completing the required culminating experience in global health.  Students may register in fall, spring, or summer. Students must select a culminating experience option, complete the required documents with the Academic Services Coordinator, and register online for the class.

Students who do not finish their culminating experience in the semester in which they registered for IH950 must register for IH951 in the next semester.     "SPH,IH 951,"Culminating Experience in Global Health, Part II"," Students who do not finish their culminating experience in the semester in which they registered for IH950 must register for IH951 in the next semester. IH950 and IH951 are zero-credit options for completing the required culminating experience in global health.  Students may register in fall, spring, or summer. Students must select a culminating experience option, complete the required documents with the Academic Services Coordinator, and register online for the class. Registering accords the student part-time status.      "SPH,LW 709,Healthcare Rationing,"Medicine, Markets and Morals  Although health care is rationed in a variety of ways in the United States, Americans, and American politicians in particular, make believe that rationing does not exist.   Indeed, efforts at health care reform have often been criticized for leading to ""rationing' health care resources, implying that rationing is something evil.   The idea that all Americans get the health care they need or that we have limitless resources is obviously not so. What health care is available and to whom is the result of the often invisible choices policy makers make.   This course critically explores the health care allocation choices that have been made and will be made in the future.  It analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of various rationing methods, the values and moral judgments reflected in each, and the political and financial factors influencing the choice of approach, as well as who should make such choices.  Examples of rationing to be discussed include the distribution of organs for transplantation, determining what constitutes ""necessary"" care under insurance schemes, the use of markets and lotteries as rationing methods, limitations on population screening, the use of age and ""social worth"" to limit health care to individuals, triage in emergencies, and the utility (or disutility) of cost-benefit analysis for making decisions about the availability and distribution of health care. By the end of the course, students will be able to articulate the range of possible rationing methods and to appropriately apply these methods to different scarce resource circumstances.       "SPH,LW 719,Essentials of Public Health Law,"Law is an essential tool for creating and implementing public health policies.

Throughout the semester students' field proposals, problems, process, and progress are discussed as are methodological issues including objectivity, sampling, data collection, ethics, and data analysis. Due to the intensive nature of the class, it is not suitable for auditors.    "SPH,SB 820,Assessment and Planning for Health Promotion," This course will introduce students to neighborhoods of Boston and provide opportunities for acquiring and practicing community assessment skills. How do public health scientists and practitioners demonstrate that a health problem in a community warrants intervention. Students will learn to consult large data sets (such as the U.S. Census, hospitalization data, vital records, MassChip, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) to determine health promotion needs of a specific neighborhoods and groups. Students will practice conducting literature reviews and health problem analyses to examine social determinants and propose webs of causation for selected health outcomes. The focus of the course is on applying both quantitative and qualitative skills, learning to present data clearly and accurately, and communicating effectively using a scientific writing style.    "SPH,SB 821,Intervention Strategies for Health Promotion," This course focuses on strategic planning for public health practice. Social science and maternal and child health approaches are included.  Working through a sequence of written assignments, students develop a strategic plan for a program intervention designed to change health behavior or a health outcome. Work in class and during individual consultations is designed to give students practice with elements of the strategic planning process, ideas for their project, and interim feedback on their written assignments.     "SPH,SB 822,Quantitative Methods for Program Evaluation," This course provides an overview of the major principles and methods associated with systematic evaluation of public health programs. The overall goal is to help students develop skills needed to plan, conduct, critique, and use evaluation research. The course covers program logic models; formative, process and outcome evaluations; internal, external, validity; threats to internal validity; experimental and quasi-experimental designs; probability and non-probability sampling; questionnaire development; operationalization of variables; statistical analysis strategies; power analysis; and analysis of evaluation design.   "SPH,SB 833,Designing and Implementing a Public Health Communication Campaign," What does it take to design a health communication campaign? Who is involved? What media should you use? What works? Should you hire an ad agency, do it yourself, and/or engage the participation of members of your target audience? These are just a few of the questions that will be addressed by students of SB833. In designing, students will develop and implement a mock health communication campaign on a topic selected by the class. The process will include topic research, audience selection, writing a communication plan, brand and message creation.  Students will ?sell? their idea by responding to an RFP. Then, students will break into groups to implement their plan.  They may create or facilitate the creation of websites, marketing materials, video, and/or any other products deemed effective and feasible.     "SPH,SB 860,Strategies for Public Health Advocacy," This course is for advanced MPH students. It will explore the role public health practitioners can play in advocating for programs and policies to improve the public's health that have been demonstrated to be effective through peer reviewed scientific research. Students will analyze the process of advocating for policy and program change based on scientific evidence at the city, state and federal level through the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government.     "SPH,SB 940,Culminating Experience in Social and Behavioral Sciences,"All Social & Behavioral Sciences concentrators must complete an integrative professional electronic portfolio as their Culminating Experience. The electronic portfolio will frame individual students' expertise, focus, experience, and skills in public health and help them to market themselves for employment as public health practitioners. Within the electronic portfolio, students will reflect upon their studies and synthesize materials from a range of courses. In integrating their knowledge, students will develop a plan of lifelong learning that reflects areas in which to bridge a knowledge gap or focus in greater depth. To document their work on the culminating experience, concentrators must register for SPH SB940, a zero-credit, pass/fail course. For more details on the requirements for the culminating experience, please see the Concentrator Guide.

"SSW,CP 759,Introduction to Clinical Social Work Practice," In this foundation clinical practice course, students learn principles and methods for assessment and intervention with individuals, groups and families. Competencies include establishing and maintaining a helping relationship, interviewing, contracting and goal setting, treatment planning and implementation. Students are able to apply appropriate interventions at various stages of the therapeutic relationship for various types of clients in an urban social context. In-class skill practice includes developing rapport, using a strengths perspective, monitoring self-disclosure, reaching for feelings, containing affect, focusing and summarizing.      "SSW,CP 762,Advanced Group Work," Building on CP 771, the course elaborates the idea of the group-as-a-whole and focuses intensively on the therapeutic tasks of group formation, attention to structure and maintenance, facilitation of individual need satisfaction, and responsiveness to the agency and community environment.  Using various theoretical frameworks and the integration of research findings, students analyze interactions and content of groups from their internships. They apply critical thinking skills and modify their interventions to meet the needs of group members from a range of backgrounds.     "SSW,CP 764,Group Dynamics," This advanced seminar in group modalities and dynamics is designed for social work students who are specializing in the group work method. The aim of the seminar is to deepen students' knowledge base and practice with group dynamics and selected group work modalities. The relationship among the group members and between members and the group facilitator(s) is a significant focus in the seminar. Throughout the seminar, emphasis is placed on enhancing students' understanding, application and evaluation of evidence-based group work (EBGW).  Attending to issues of ethics and issues of diversity--class, age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation -- are woven throughout the seminar. The seminar is organized to include opportunities for a critical analysis of group dynamics, single-session experiential groups, and various group exercises. Priority is given to the further development of the professional 'group worker' in roles as leader, consultant and presenter. A highlighted component of the seminar includes Guest Presenters who are expert in specific group work modalities or with specific populations.  The Presenters will aid the students in the seminar to hone a deeper understanding of facilitator interventions and use of self in the group setting.    "SSW,CP 770,Clinical Practice with Individuals," The purpose of this course is to deepen skills of differential assessment, formulation, and intervention with individuals.  Three theoretical approaches guide this work Cognitive (focusing on thoughts, feelings, and behavior), Behavioral (focusing on monitoring and reinforcing positive behavior), and Psychodynamic (focusing on dysfunctional childhood patterns repeated in the present). Using these perspectives, students analyze videotaped treatment sessions, demonstrate therapeutic approaches through classroom skill-practice, and present cases from their field internships for analysis and discussion.  Students also learn to make five-axial clinical diagnoses using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.   "SSW,CP 771,Clinical Practice with Groups," Students build on skills learned in CP 759 by examining group work methods with a range of client populations, in various community and clinical settings, and with differing client problems/issues of concern. Attention is paid to race, culture, gender, and class and to social and environmental stressors as students make decisions about group composition, contracting, problem solving and successfully terminating groups    "SSW,CP 772,Clinical Practice with Families," Students build on family theory, dynamics and skills learned in CP 759. They deepen their ability to build alliances with the family as a whole, assess families using common family assessment tools, and develop hypotheses about the family's experiences, structure and internal dynamics that may contribute to the presenting problem. Particular attention is paid to family structure, roles, rules and life cycle. Students practice the therapeutic techniques of joining and reflecting, employing the genogram to help families think differently about their history, identifying strengths and resilience in the family as a whole, motivating the family to change, and facilitating communication shifts and experimentation with new behavior. Emphasis is places on the clinician's use of self in working with diverse families who present with a range of problems and are seen in various community and clinical settings.    "SSW,CP 785,Family Therapy," This advanced practice course builds on CP 772 and enhances the systemic paradigm shift by providing a broad overview of major family therapy approaches and of contemporary issues in and research on family therapy.  Students then concentrate on a few approaches and populations to facilitate developing family-centered therapeutic skills for assessment and intervention.  The usefulness of utilizing a systems perspective to address issues in an urban context of social justice, at risk-populations and the effects of oppression will be embedded throughout the specific topics addressed in this course.  Attention also will be given to diverse client systems and students are encouraged to bring up families they are working with for class discussion.  Students observe and study videotapes of family therapists to practice assessment skills, develop an understanding of evidence-based clinical interventions and build proficiency in helping families with communication, organization and expression of feelings.   They also explore and evaluate how the different models fit their own personal style.  Class participation, including mini-exercises, role-plays, and discussion, will play a large role in augmenting reading assignments, lectures, and tapes.    "SSW,CP 787,Clinical Practice with Couples," This course provides an overview of the major theories and techniques of couples and marital therapy with an emphasis on empirically validated approaches to practice with couples. Throughout the course we incorporate an ecological understanding of family systems within the context of the multiple systems in which couple and family life is lived. Specific attention will be paid to the needs of the following populations; same-sex couples, inter-racial and inter-cultural couples; couples who have experienced physical aggression and infidelity; and couples living with chronic illness, histories of sexual abuse, and substance abuse.  Students will explore and evaluate how the different models of social work practice with couples fit their own personal styles.  Mini-exercises, skill-practice and class discussion play a significant role, as do lectures and viewing videotapes.  As a group, students provide an in-class, theory-based instructional presentation and demonstration of a couples counseling session.    "SSW,CP 791,Seminar,"Family Therapy  This is the second course in the sequence for Family Therapy Certificate Program students, building on CP 785 by providing increased depth and range of content as well as examining the research base for family systems approaches. The course will explore contemporary issues within the field of family therapy and family centered social work practice.  Students will consider several prominent theories of family therapy, their more recent expressions within the professional literature, and how to consider them against the standards of evidenced based practice.  In particular, we will explore and critique what actually counts as evidence during clinical treatment in the hope of better defining where theory and practice actually come together.  At the completion of the course students will come away with a better understanding of the cutting edge controversies and professional concerns within the family therapy field.  Students will also be able to apply new learning to the processes of treatment application and outcome assessment.   "SSW,CP 793,Directed Study,Directed Study. Approval of instructor needed.     SSW,CP 794,Clinical Practice with Children," This course focuses on differential assessment and treatment of children and adolescents. It emphasizes activation of an affective therapeutic relationship with children and adolescents, with special attention to transference and countertransference, the distinction between narrative truth and historic truth, and special treatment concerns when working with severely traumatized or mentally ill children and adolescents. Students learn to differentiate between functional, organic, developmental, behavioral, and ethno-cultural factors in assessment of children and adolescents. Specialized treatment techniques include dramatization, metaphorical communication, and various forms of therapeutic play.    "SSW,CP 795,Cognitive and Behavioral Treatment," Students learn the theoretical frameworks underlying cognitive and behavioral treatment (CBT) for adults and children including operant and respondent conditioning theory and cognitive models based mainly on A. T. Beck's theories.  Students learn cognitive/behavioral analysis (also called case formulation) and assessment of specific problem areas and disorders using students' current child and adult cases. The CBT treatment and session structure, format, and planning is emphasized. Several intervention methods are illustrated and practiced using case examples, video and ""live"" demonstrations and role plays. These include a variety of reinforcement procedures, assertiveness and social skills training, problem-solving, behavioral activation, exposure procedures (desensitization treatment of anxiety) and cognitive treatments (e.g., cognitive restructuring, working with automatic thoughts and core beliefs). Students distinguish cognitive and behavioral theories as to how they inform a case formulation and selection of intervention. As cognitive behavior change must be transparent and collaborative, special attention is also paid to the client/therapist relationship, application of CBT methods for diverse populations, and ethical issues. Students learn to search and discuss empirical findings regarding effective CBT interventions as well as evaluate the effectiveness of assessments and cognitive and behavioral treatment methods relevant to their client's target problem. Students present their own cases from their field placements to be used in discussion of CBT assessment and intervention methods for specific problems/disorders in order to address the specific needs and considerations relevant to the clientele being served.    "SSW,CP 798,Psychodynamic Practice with Adults," Students will expand on knowledge of psychodynamic practice gained in CP 770. They will examine additional theoretical approaches within a psychodynamic framework--Object Relations, Self-Psychology, and Ego Psychology and draw on a strengths perspective and apply these approaches to vulnerable populations and culturally diverse populations in multiple treatment settings. Students will leave the course with an ability to (a) describe and demonstrate the theoretical basis of each psychodynamic approach, (b) assess, analyze and evaluate client needs and treatment progress using a psychodynamic lens, and (c) explain the research that provides support for the psychodynamic approach.      "SSW,CP 799,Brief and Time-Effective Treatment," This course surveys a range of brief and time effective treatment models including crisis intervention/single session interventions, solution focused brief therapy, narrative therapy, and stages of change/motivational interviewing. Students will develop skills  in brief treatment that can be used with children, adolescents, families, and adults who present with substance use, trauma, depression, anxiety, domestic violence, and other issues of concern in multi-stressed urban populations.  Students will acquire understanding of the theoretical and empirical bases, strengths, and limitations of each model. Use of in-class and videotaped role plays along with small group exercises will help students become more creative, flexible,  and accountable in their approaches to treatment, and will direct students away from a deficit (pathology) model towards a resource (possibility) treatment model. Students learn to collaborate with clients to create well-formed treatment goals, and to measure change as it occurs over time. Finally, students explore how their own values and beliefs about change may help or hinder clinical practice in the current health care environment.

Ethics and the Social Work Profession (ET 753), examines the    issues of social work professionalism, the process of becoming a social work    professional, the tensions inherent in the goals of social work, and the ways    these interrelate to produce conflicts of values and ethics in social work    practice. The course focuses on acquiring and practicing the skills of ethical    decision-making, including values clarification, application of ethical theory,    utilization of codes of ethics, and models of ethical analysis. Both clinical    and macro aspects of social work are explored, with an emphasis on the    contemporary challenges of practice in multicultural and urban settings. Issues    of self-care, impairment, licensure, malpractice, whistle-blowing and other    professional challenges are explored. The course is set in the advanced    curriculum as an integrative capstone, designed to be concurrent with the    student's final semester in the MSW program.

The goal of the course is to enable students to develop a framework for analyzing human behavior in order to create empathic, empowering relationships with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. A select set of theories is presented to enable students to examine how individuals and communities develop and interact. We also consider how oppression, power and privilege, and culture and cultural contexts can shape individual values, beliefs, worldviews, and identities, all of which play a role in the helping process.  Finally, we examine human development throughout the lifespan, considering the developmental scientific knowledge base regarding opportunities and vulnerabilities present during the different stages of the lifecycle, and the biopsychosocial and cultural factors that can influence individual development. The ability to analyze human behavior in the social environment, drawing from theoretically and empirically grounded evidence bases is essential for all forms of social work practice.     "SSW,HB 723,Adult Psychopathology," The goal of this course is to provide students with a framework for  understanding human behavior when challenges to healthy adult functioning  overwhelm coping mechanisms and resources.  A biopsychosocial model of  psychopathology is emphasized as we study some of the disorders classified in  the DSM-5, including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, psychotic disorders,  PTSD, dissociative disorders, personality disorders, eating disorders, and  substance abuse/addictions. Complex factors in the etiology of various disorders  are considered, including genetic, neurochemical, biological, developmental,  familial, sociocultural, and political variables that affect the occurrence,  presentation, course, and treatment of a problem.  While learning the  perspective and language of the phenomenological approach outlined in the DSM-5,  we also highlight weaknesses and blind spots in the traditional approach to  diagnoses.  In particular, we explore the impact of oppression and bias on the  naming and treatment of mental disorders, including the influences of race,  gender, sexual orientation, class, disability, religion, and ethnicity on the  diagnostic process.  Students learn to consider the DSM-5 classification system  as a social construction that reveals as much about the society and its views of  human behavior as it does about the clients with whom social workers have  contact.    While this course is not designed to focus on treatment, students  have the opportunity to consider how diagnoses inform treatment and review  current research on both biological and psychosocial treatments for different  disorders.  Finally, we seek to enhance empathic understanding of our clients  experiences and the experiences of their families and loved ones, remembering  that people are not their diagnoses, that what is labeled individual pathology  may be an adaptive response to oppressive external circumstances, and that  people who experience a breakdown in functioning demonstrate not only  difficulties but also compelling strengths.  This course employs lecture, large  and small group discussion, case presentations, and videotapes.  Clinical  vignettes from instructors and class are used to illustrate mental disorders and  theoretical perspectives, and make material relevant to clinical practice,  particularly with urban populations    "SSW,HB 727,Child Psychopathology," Grad Prereq SSW HB 720 or permission of department chair.  *This course uses a developmental psychopathological model to explore complex psychological disturbances in children, adolescents, and families with a focus on the urban family experience.  It addresses multiple research and theoretical perspectives that promote a way of understanding ?normal? and ?pathological? child and adolescent behaviors that change over time in the context of their genetic make-up, biological processes, interpersonal relationships, culture, and available community resources and support.  In this course, developmental, systemic, psychodynamic, neurobiological and behavioral theoretical perspectives inform students? understanding of children and adolescents? adaptive and maladaptive patterns of behavior, which evolve over time in the context of their complex developmental histories and socio-cultural relational experiences.  The course promotes the importance of assessing in children and families both the historical and present risks for disturbed behavioral development and the historical and present protective factors that promote healthy and resilient behavioral development.  Implied throughout the course curriculum is the perspective that a deep understanding of children?s adaptations to stress and trauma is central in the social worker?s role of making informed and accurate assessments and diagnostic evaluations of children, adolescents, and families.  Discussion of clinical case material and relevant research assists students in learning to assess children and adolescents? current, unique developmental needs and strengths with a goal of empowering them to find pathways of behavior that better meet these developmental needs and give freedom to the deepening of these strengths. 3 cr.   "SSW,HB 729,Human Sexuality," Through readings, discussion, lectures, guest speakers, films, and other methods, students explore the broad range of issues concerning human sexuality. This course covers the facts of human sexuality and reproductive health. Students examine their own values and opinions concerning sexuality. There is an opportunity to discuss improving communication with clients about sexual issues, with an emphasis on examining client resistance to talking about sexual issues, and the impact of the social worker's discomfort with or avoidance of this topic. This course also considers the rationale for including sexual issues with client interactions, as well as the importance of taking a sexual history as a part of any clinical interaction.     "SSW,HB 735,Racial Justice and Cultural Oppression," This course examines the social psychological, and institutional causes and implications of racism as a dynamic force influencing social work. The course builds on and integrates concepts presented in foundation courses.  It analyzes and evaluates the social, cultural, political, economic, and interpersonal contexts of racism that bear on our current policies and institutional arrangements. The course is designed to familiarize students with 1) theoretical overviews of race and racism; 2)historical accounts and contemporary experiences of racism; 3) the formation of racial identity; 4) multicultural contexts and fundamentals of cultural competency; and 5) effective social change efforts based on organizational analysis.     "SSW,HB 736,Directed Study,Directed Study. Approval of instructor needed.    SSW,HB 741,Family Violence in Society," This course introduces students to the dynamics of family violence and its multiple effects on children, adults, and communities. It draws from current evidence from social work, the social sciences, and neurobiology to frame our theoretical understanding of family violence. We also review a number of prevention and intervention programs for a variety of populations. Special attention is given to the impact of violence upon vulnerable populations, including women, children, and elders. The course also discusses current knowledge regarding the perpetration of family violence, with a specific focus on intimate partner violence, child physical abuse, and child sexual abuse. The course equips students to work competently and in an evidence-informed manner in family violence research, advocacy, practice ,and policy. Specifically, students deepen their understanding of the following theoretical frameworks for understanding the etiology and dynamics of multiple forms of family violence in society, the historical and contemporary influences in current social policy related to family violence, and prevention and intervention approaches for individuals and communities affected by family violence.    "SSW,HB 743,Social Work with Refugees and Immigrants," Social workers and other mental health and social service practitioners find themselves increasingly called upon to work with refugees and immigrants from around the world.  Social workers are also becoming sought after by international development agencies and non-governmental organizations. In this course we gain an understanding of the refugee and immigrant experience and of the continuum of the acculturation process.  We examine the potential problems facing these individuals and families as they seek to rebuild their lives; we learn to recognize and utilize their strengths, cultural resources and natural support systems; and we increase our cultural competence by learning skills for culturally appropriate relationship-building, clinical assessment, and intervention.     "SSW,HB 744,Spirituality and Social Work Practice," The goal of this course is to acquaint the student with current theories regarding religion and spirituality and their role in clinical work.  Particular attention is given to the function of spirituality and religion in bridging internal and external adaptations throughout the life cycle.  Utilizing psychodynamic and narrative frameworks, this course addresses ways of assessing and working with an individual?s spiritual and existential belief systems and attending to the ways in which spiritual beliefs and practices provide a window into a client?s inner world.  In addition, the course addresses issues of transference and countertransference as they arise in the exploration of religious and spiritual material in psychotherapy.  The course draws heavily on case material, film, and fiction.     "SSW,HB 746,Resilience Across the Lifespan," Humans have an amazing capacity to adapt well to adversity?a phenomenon known as resilience. This course uses a resilience framework to explore development across the lifespan, with implications for social work practice. The approach presumes that resilience results from dynamic interactions between individuals and their environments, and that every person has the potential to overcome significant challenge at any point in the life course. The construct of resilience has become well-used in social science fields, perhaps as a reaction to deficit models of development, or as part of a renewed focus on human strengths. As a result, greater attention is paid to those who do well ?despite the odds,? and on the environmental contexts that support these adaptations.  The course examines conceptual, empirical, and applied work on resilience, including new and sometimes controversial applications of resilience theory to social work practice with individuals, families, and communities.    "SSW,HB 747,Childhood Maltreatment & Social Work Practice,"Developmental Perspectives  By virtue of their direct practice roles in a range of agencies that offer health and human services to children, youth, and families, social workers are in an ideal position to address childhood maltreatment and their developmental sequelae. This course uses an ecological perspective, risk/resilience framework, and developmental perspective to examine conceptual, empirical, and applied work on childhood maltreatment such as physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. We will examine, from a variety of theoretical frameworks, the factors, indicators, and dynamics associated with childhood maltreatment. Prevention, practice, policy and research issues will be critically assessed. Particular attention will be given to understanding developmental sequelae of childhood maltreatment, including emotional/behavioral problems and addictive behaviors.   "SSW,HB 749,Social Perspectives on Health and Illness," This course is designed to orient students toward major contemporary health issues and to foster an understanding of the way that social, environmental, and cultural contexts can contribute to either health or illness. The course is premised on the notion that understanding how context influences these outcomes is of direct importance to social work practice in a variety of domains. The course is organized into three modules. The first introduces students to important historical, theoretical, and current perspectives on health and illness and provides the groundwork for the rest of the course. The second module focuses on health and illness using the social ecology of health model. The last module focuses on emergent issues in health and illness, integrating the knowledge from the first two modules in order to demonstrate to students the multitude of ways in which social contexts can jointly promote health-related outcomes.    "SSW,HB 750,Organizational Behavior and Culture," This course familiarizes the student with basic concepts related to organizational behavior and culture in human service organizations. The primary focus is on how human service organizations function, with a particular focus on the influence of internal and external factors, and methods for achieving change within these settings.     "SSW,HB 751,Human Neuropsychology," Students develop foundational knowledge in the structure and function of the nervous system with special emphasis on processes underlying common neuropsychological disorders. The course is designed to make basic neuroscience accessible and interesting for students with a minimum of basic science background.We cover basic neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, neurochemistry and nervous system development in the context of neuropsychological disorders to provide a clinical context for material that might otherwise seem overwhelming.

The primary focus is on community and agency analysis, along with methods of achieving change within those settings. Students acquire a basic framework for problem solving and an understanding of the opportunities and limits in the role of change agent.    "SSW,MP 773,Human Services Management," This is an advanced methods course in social administration/management covering topics in planning, supervision, performance appraisal, budgeting, and organizational theory. It is an ideal course for both clinical and macro students who want to develop management skills that they can use in their professional practices. The course examines the ethical dilemmas of administering social programs  and managing human service agencies in the context of a market economy where federal and state budget cuts have created competition for scarce resources. Students are introduced to basic management theories, organizational structure, supervision, performance appraisal, leadership, and conflict resolution. This is a prerequisite to all subsequent courses in the Human Services Management Program.    "SSW,MP 774,Seminar,Community Planning  This course examines a variety of themes regarding program development at a community level. Opportunities for public speaking are emphasized.

The course seeks to open  up reflection, study, and dialogue about vocation, work, and spirituality in religious traditions and in our  own life experience. Work and vocation are often connected. Work too is a crucial religious question in  contemporary society. Work exerts a powerful--and often unrecognized--influence on human beings. It  can support life, develop talents, elicit creativity, and enable people to contribute to the common good.  Work also can demean human beings, undermining their dignity, perpetuating unjust structures,  overpowering values, and crowding out other important spheres of life.

Through this work and additional readings, including careful reading of and theological reflection on daily newspapers, we will together identify and address a range of issues facing the church in diverse cultures and contexts. Students gain skills in identifying practical theological questions and interpreting contexts; critically incorporating social scientific research in a theological project; making normative judgments; and thinking through strategic practical theological responses to guide faithful Christian practice. The course is a required core course for all doctoral students majoring in Practical Theology.     "STH,TJ 910,Proseminar in Practical Theology,"This doctoral seminar for practical theology majors introduces the primary changes that are under way in  practical theology as a discipline, reviews the methodologies upon which these changes are based, and  examines the implications of these changes.     "STH,TJ 940,Ecclesiology,"This course asks the question, ""What is the church?"" in dialogue with Christian  theological figures and schools representing Roman Catholic, Protestant, and  Orthodox Christian traditions. While one of the aims of this course is that  students be conversant with those voices, it ultimately aims at the student's  ability to articulate the ecclesiology of his or her own community and to bring  that to bear on the contemporary situation and particular problems of Christian  practice in church and society.     "STH,TJ 976,Advanced Research in Practical Theology,"In this advanced research seminar, students will explore a range of practical theology research to map the field. They will analyze the purposes, practices, and significance of this research for the field of practical theology and for the larger human community. Students will have opportunities to develop expertise with selected research tools; develop a significant research question of high personal interest; and conduct a research project that contributes to the literature and some part of the human or ecological community.    "STH,TM 801,Christian Mission in a Religiously Plural World,"This course is focused on constructing a theology of mission that is appropriate, adequate, and relevant   for the 21st century's religious plurality.  The aim of the course is to enable students to 1) recall a quick   critical survey of the history of Christian mission, 2) grapple with the varied biblical understandings of   mission, and 3) begin to frame and articulate a theology of mission that addresses the challenges posed by   the religiously plural world    "STH,TM 808,"Three Missionary Faiths (Buddhism, Christianity, Islam) and Their Importance for Global Development","The terms ""missionary"" and ""development"" often prompt images of Western Christians working away from home.  Much has been written about European colonial era missionaries and Western-led interventions around the world. But Christianity is not the only missionary world religion nor do modern development efforts fall within the sole purview of Western powers.  This course will examine the missionary nature of Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam and consider the ways in which all three faiths think about engagement with the world in an era of climate change, resource wars, and global economic inequity.  Using an inter-disciplinary approach that examines religious adherents' worldviews the course will concentrate on how the thinking patterns of followers of these three faith traditions translate into actions.  We will also reflect on the ways in which the modern development enterprise itself exhibits missionary characteristics.  Particular attention will go towards contexts in which interactions among the religious traditions and secular development interventions are taking place.  Guest speakers, site visits, and multimedia presentations will complement reading assignments and classroom discussions.    "STH,TM 815,Christian Mission,"Exploration of biblical, historical, theological, political, and cultural  perspectives on the world mission of the church.

This situation, known as  ""overshoot,"" has largely arisen from  hyper-development. If nothing is done, in several decades there will  be vast  species extinction, food and fuel shortages, and social unrest. Today's young  children could also  expect to grow old in a catastrophically degraded world.  Many analysts say a cultural and spiritual  awakening, including a major rethink  of humanity's mission and purpose, is needed to alter this future  scenario. So  the purpose of this course is to prepare students who can help bring about such  an  awakening. We will engage Christian theological viewpoints with those of  concerned economists,  philosophers, and organizational behaviorists. And we will  experiment with practical applications of key  concepts necessary to positive  change.

The purpose of the course is to introduce the student to the social world that  produced the New Testament and other early Christian literature, including martyrdoms and apologies. We  will read primary and secondary sources on Roman history (early imperial period), ancient Judaism (from  Alexander the Great to the revolt by the messianic figure Bar Kochba), Greco-Roman religions (with focus  on the ""pagan spirituality"" of the ancient mystery religions), and the reaction by Roman magistrates and  pagan intellectuals to the new Christian movement. Such context is essential for reconstructing the life,  religion, society, and culture of the ancient Christians.

We, the rich and the poor, often coexist in close    proximity, as neighbors and strangers, folk passing each other, sometimes unseen, in grocery stores  and   gas stations, people who interact or, more often, live in segregated silences within church and  society. At   the global level, too, the pattern of passing and unseeing exchange recurs in engagements  (whether   economic, political, or cultural) among nations of great wealth and the world's poor. This class  engages   New Testament texts and early Christian communities' own struggles with poverty, status, and  class   differences as a springboard for deep discussions of the moral life around issues of poverty and  economic   justice.

In the first third of the course, we ask   how, in comparison to our own, first century C.E. Jews, Greeks, and Romans seem to have constructed and   enacted their gender identities. In the latter two thirds of the course, we analyze how these gender   categories impacted early Christianity and how, in turn, adherents shaped them in their own identity   formation and theological explorations. Primary sources include Greco-Roman, Second-Temple Jewish,   New Testament, and other early Christian texts.

We will   begin read ancients from Aristotle to Dio Chrysostom who talked about friendship to create a set of   portraits of elite friendship. We will then read Philippians in light of this common portrait, addressing the   interrelationship of believers as ""friends""; the importance of imitation, unity, suffering righteousness, and   love, for Christian living; the question of the identity of the Philippians' opponents; and challenges of   understanding themselves as a distinctive ""commonwealth"" within a Roman imperial colony. We will engage   modern concerns arising from these emphases throughout the course, as we place them in conversation   with the social, ethical, and theological struggles faced by first-century non-Jewish converts who were   forming new identities as Christians and seeking to understand both their relationship to Judaism and their   place within the Roman Empire.

Decent Care bases  the planning, delivery and evaluation of care on values  that place individuals, in their social and cultural  contexts, at the center of the caring process. The aims of  decent care are to develop health systems around  the primacy of persons in their own health care, and to  build a bridge between the principles of human  rights and the practice of medicine. By listening to and  honoring the voices of the people care processes  and models can be developed that respond to the needs  of a community enabling human flourishing.

In the 21st  century, as space explorations expand, Contact with extraterrestrial life-- including intelligent life--becomes ever more possible (some people already  claim to have had visual or physical contact with UFOs and their alien  occupants). Using perspectives from science, science fiction, religion, and  United Nations space treaties, and narratives about peoples' claims of  encounters with extraterrestrial beings, this course will discuss current and  projected understandings of the human place in the cosmos; reflect on how  discovery of extraterrestrial life might impact the human sense of place in the  universe; and consider how the impacts of ET encounters (actual or theoretical)  might be positively incorporated into human consciousness and contexts.   "STH,TS 800,International Conflict and the Ministry of Reconciliation,"This course proposes a theology of reconciliation for religious peace-building in the realms of ethnic division and nationalism, race, economic injustice and environmental degradation.

His vision of the kinship of all peoples, born out of the particularity of his own personal struggles, propelled him into the Protestant mainstream as a distinctive interpreter of the church's role in a democratic society.  He influenced a younger generation of ethical leaders in the modern Civil Rights Movement, including Martin Luther King, Jr., Pauli Murray, Marian Wright Edelman, Whitney Young, Jesse Jackson, and Vernon Jordan.    "STH,TS 805,The Spirit and the Art of Conflict Transformation,"Creating a Culture of  JustPeace This course is a response to the experience of destructive conflict in the  church and in the world, as well  as the experience of religion as a source of  conflict.

This course explores these contributions  to an  understanding of power, both divine and human, and the ways in which practices  and professions of  religious traditions can be both death-dealing and life- giving. How does power operate on bodies, in  institutions, in global markets?  What is the fuel ""the power"" necessary for social change and  transformation?  Examining critical moments in 20th century movements of liberation, this course  draws  on theory, theology, literature, and media to give theological depth and  understanding to religious claims  about love, power, and justice.

One of the interesting features in the modern period has been the    revival of Confucian-Christian dialogue. (Requires TF 701/702 or equivalent)    "STH,TT 898,Theology and Trauma,"This course aims to bring the recent studies in the interdisciplinary study of  trauma to bear on the field of  theology. What unique challenges does the  phenomenon of trauma pose to contemporary theology?  The  first part of the  course explores recent studies in trauma, focusing on three areas of research  1)  neurobiology of trauma, 2) clinical/therapeutic studies, and 3) literary  approaches to trauma.   The second  part of the course examines theological  engagements with issues of radical suffering.  The third part  brings together  the insights from the first two and focuses on the question of what it means to  witness  theologically to individual, societal, and global trauma. We will look  at issues and contexts such as the  criminal justice system, war, poverty, and  racism. In this final part, students will be working towards  constructive  theological engagements with issues of trauma through interaction with a variety  of  mediums art, literature, spiritual practices, and film.    The course is not  a counseling course. It aims to  provide rich theological reflection around  issues of suffering, violence, and trauma, both individual and  global.

The   course focuses on The Christian Faith (CF) but also  covers some  other of his writings particularly On   Religion Speeches to Its Cultured  Despisers (OR) and Letters  to L推_cke (LL) and some biographical   material. The  secondary aim is to help students develop their own  theological ideas in  detailed   conversation with Schleiermacher's, a purpose for which CF is  particularly well  suited. (Requires TF  701/702 or equivalent)   "STH,TT 900,The Theological Imagination,"Within the arena of constructive theology, theologians are increasingly describing their theological projects  in terms of analyzing and reshaping ""imaginaries."" The course traces the emergence of this 'turn to the  imaginary' within modernity and postmodernity and examines what's at stake theologically in this turn.  This seminar involves 1) exploring the concept of 'the imaginary,' identifying philosophical, sociological  and literary influences; 2) articulating what's at stake for theology; and 3) constructing theological visions  that can expand the study and practices of Christian traditions. The first part situates the rise of the  concept of the imaginary within the context of modern theology. Here, we will examine the varying reasons  for theological appeals to the imagination, asking what's at stake for each and will examine the portrait  that each presents of theology's relationship to modernity. We will be engaging questions of the nature and  task of theology, theological method, immanence/transcendence, and religious language. The second part  will focus on critiques of the western (Christian) imaginary. In this part, we take a decidedly postmodern  turn and explore the appeals to the imaginary from various thinkers who are trying to reshape the  imaginary otherwise. The third part will focus on the form of theology and explore the implications of our  study for the re-forming of theological discourse.

"STH,TT 913,Science and Religion,"Quantum entanglement is one of the most remarkable ideas to have emerged from physics in the twentieth    century. Identified as a consequence of quantum theory already in the 1920s, it was not confirmed as a    physical phenomenon until the 1980s. The broader implications of living in an ""entangled"" world are only    beginning to be felt outside the walls of physics. This course explores the significance of quantum    entanglement for theological reflection on creaturely and divine relationality.    "STH,TT 921,Proseminar,"Religion and Science This doctoral level seminar provides an advanced introduction to the core literature and issues of the interdisciplinary field of religion and science. The primary texts are Ian Barbour's Religion and Science Historical and Contemporary Issues, John Hedley Brooke's Science and Religion Some Historical Perspectives, the edited collection titled Religion and Science"STH,TT 923,Philosophical Cosmology,"The purpose of this course is to introduce students to major positions in  philosophical cosmology relative to the twin questions of the nature of God and  scientific knowledge of the natural world.  Connected with both of these is the  question of where value lies in the world, if anywhere, given the assumptions of  a fact-value distinction in modern science. The main interest will be with  discussions in the West, although some comparative points will be made.     "STH,TT 924,Theological Aesthetics,"Why is the retrieval of beauty essential in an age of terror? Grace Jantzen suggests that a displacement of beauty in western consciousness can be directly correlated with the increase of violence in post/modernity. Following Jantzen神尽 call for a theology of beauty, we will explore the significance of aesthetics in the current religious landscape. Using Hans Urs von Balthasar神尽 theological aesthetics as a lens for exploring the relationship between beauty and the divine, we will examine key works in western thought in which beauty plays a significant role (Plato, Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius, John Damascene, Bonaventure, Kierkegaard). In the second half of the course, we will survey recent discussions of aesthetics in continental philosophy, literature, and ethics as they intersect with the study of religion (using Continental Aesthetics Reader). In these latter sessions, we will focus on specialized topics sacred space, sacred dance, sacred bodies and advertising, and sacred writing in order to see how the theory engaged in the first part of the course informs contemporary issues. What impact does this theological retrieval have on contemporary discussions of justice, trauma, conflict, and terror? What role could theological aesthetics play in a heavily visual culture? Although we will trace beauty predominantly through Christian thought, students are encouraged to pursue projects in which they explore the aesthetic dimensions of other religions.

"STH,TT 934,Schleiermacher,"The primary aim of this course is read and understand the theology of Friedrich Daniel Ernst  Schleiermacher, one  of the most important and influential European intellectuals of the 19th century, and  known variously as the Father  of Romanticism, the Father of Hermeneutics, the Father of German Plato  studies, the Father of Modern Protestant  Theology, and the Father of Liberal Christian Theology. The  course focuses on The Christian Faith (CF) but also  covers some other of his writings particularly On  Religion Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers (OR) and Letters  to Locke (LL) and some biographical material.  The secondary aim is to help students develop their own  theological ideas in detailed conversation with  Schleiermacher's, a purpose for which CF is particularly well  suited.  The class has 800-level and 900-level  designations to accommodate both advanced masters and doctoral students,  respectively.    "STH,TT 945,"Spirituality, Medicine & Health","The general aim of this science-religion course is to learn about the complex entanglements among religious traditions and spirituality, medical traditions and healing modalities, and norms for physical and mental health. This will involve (i) in Part 1 of the course, gaining a basic grasp on the history of the medical traditions of China, India, the Middle East, and the West, including the metaphysical frameworks that inform those traditions; (ii) in Part 2 of the course, studying the complex controversy over spirituality and health research and attempting to decide whether and how the efficacy of healing modalities is to be evaluated; (iii) in Part 3 of the course, understanding how western biomedicine interacts with the array of medical traditions and spiritually inspired healing modalities that thrive in the West; and (iv) throughout the course, addressing philosophical, theological, and ethical questions about norms for mental and physical health and comparing metaphysical frameworks for health and healing. The class is intended for advanced masters students and doctoral candidates interested in the science-religion dialogue, and particularly in spirituality and health.     "STH,TT 946,Advanced Systematic Theology I,"God and Creation A study of creations as the fundamental religious relation between God and the world, defining both.

Examines the church and the religious practices of ritual, symbol making, and paths of spiritual perfection. Develops a systematic doctrine of the Holy Spirit and the church.   "STH,TT 949,Hermeneutics for Teaching and Preaching,"The purpose of this course is to hone skills at the doctoral level in various tasks of hermeneutics (fancy  word for interpretation) necessary for preaching and religious education.  Religious life has both ultimate  predicaments and ultimate ecstatic fulfillments.  These can be sorted roughly into five basic problematics  that take various forms in nearly all religions, although this course will focus on Christianity with some  informal treatments of other religions.  These problematics are (1) living under obligation, with issues of  righteousness, discernment of justice and morality, guilt, and forgiveness, (2) the quest for personal  wholeness, with issues of suffering, brokenness, dignity, and sanctification, (3) the engagement of others,  with issues of ingroup/outgroup distinctions, loving enemies, loving in different ways, and loving nature,  (4) the attainment of a value-identity in ultimate perspective, with issues of the meaning of life and coping  with finitude and ambiguity, and (5) gratitude for sheer existence, with issues of radical contingency,  affirmation of life and death, and union with and distance from God.  Each of these problematics singly and  in combination with others has been called ""salvation,"" but the complexity of religion requires that they be  thought together and each one interpreted to the others. The four domains of hermeneutics (scripture,  experience, tradition, and reason) will be explored through the grid of these five religious problematics.     "STH,TT 954,Scientific Approaches to Religion,"This seminar examines interpretations of religious beliefs, behaviors, and experiences deriving from the  biological, evolutionary, psychological, cognitive, neurological, and medical sciences.

The seminar will read a variety of works in  contemporary religious naturalism, from twentieth-century classics to current contributions, and from  theoretical analyses of the meaning of naturalism to surveys attempting to map out the territory of  plausible viewpoints. We will also track the close relationship between religious naturalism and both  ecologically-rooted forms of spirituality and nature-centered forms of mysticism.    "STH,TT 966,Fem/Womani Theo,"Cannot provide class description."STH,TT 974,Religious Experience,"This seminar is a multidisciplinary study of religious experience, drawing on  philosophy, theology, literature, psychology, sociology, the cognitive sciences,  and the neurosciences.

Advanced master's students can participate with the  permission of the instructor.     "STH,TT 998,Theology and Trauma,"This course aims to bring the recent studies in the interdisciplinary study of trauma to bear on the field  of theology. What unique challenges does the phenomenon of trauma pose to contemporary theology?  The first part of the course explores recent studies in trauma, focusing on three areas of research 1)  neurobiology of trauma, 2) clinical/therapeutic studies, and 3) literary approaches to trauma. The  second part of the course examines theological engagements with issues of radical suffering. The third  part brings together the insights from the first two and focuses on the question of what it means to  witness theologically to individual, societal, and global trauma.

The course is not a counseling course. It aims to  provide rich theological reflection around issues of suffering, violence, and trauma, both individual and  global.  "STH,TY 704,Introduction to Pastoral Care and Counseling,"This course introduces a method of pastoral care as practical theology. Students will learn to assess the  experiences of loss, violence, and addiction reflected in pastoral care conversations. They will use  theological, psychological, and cultural studies to reflect upon these issues of loss or violence, and develop  theologically based strategies of care and justice.     "STH,TY 803,The Psychology of Religion,Examining methodological questions and issues in the psychological interpretation  of religious matters by  considering what is meant by 'religion' and what is  involved in interpreting 'religion' psychologically.     STH,TY 806,Theories of Human Development,"Human Development Course Description The goal of this course is to achieve an  understanding of the  human developmental process and how that process integrates  the growth of faith and the life of the  community.  We will use a series of  theoretical readings, broader lectures by the professor, and selected   autobiographies to apply theory.  As our experiences provide excellent  laboratory data, there will be  various opportunities to examine our own life  processes as a way of seeing theory in action.  Course  Objectives By the end of  the class, students should know the primary developmental theories, including   psychodynamic, cognitive, behavioral, social learning, faith development and be  able to identity of variety  of lesser used theories - be able to critique  developmental theories using the insights of feminist theory,  studies in racism  and sexual identity, and the reality of globalization - be able to apply theory  to case  material - discuss the relationship of human development and community  context"STH,TY 811,Object Relations and the Study of Religion,"Achieving familiarity with and fluency in a series of psychoanalytic theories of  personality/character, development, relationships, motivation, health, and  pathology, as a context in which to practice psychoanalytic interpretations of  religious matters.    "STH,TY 814,Womanist Psychologies of Religion,"This seminar course will ""engage womanist theology and ethics, womanist pastoral and practical  theology for their embedded psychologies of religion. We will examine psychological aspects of Black  women's religious experience in the U.S. Of particular interest will be the place, relationship and  significance of black religious experience as a particular(ized) cultural psychological construction and  experience. Additionally, we will take up for consideration the theological basis for articulating a  womanist psychology of religion, and the argument that womanist epistemology, theological  anthropology as well as practical and pastoral theologies are embedded in psychological dynamics and  require an explicit articulation of a (psychoanalytic) psychology of religion.     "STH,TY 821,Psychoanalysis of/and Spirituality,"Examines the growing engagement between psychoanalysis and spirituality. Historically this has been contested ground with psychoanalytic theorists having little regard for religion and spirituality beyond the realm of a psychological interpretation.  Over the last two decades, this has shifted and a number of works have been either written about psychoanalysis as spirituality; psychoanalyst's spiritual practices, and/or psychoanalysis of spirituality.  The emphasis of these conversations has resulted in conferences dedicated to the topic as well as psychoanalysts specializing in spirituality.  The impact on studies in spirituality has produced a more conscious interest in the relevance of psychodynamic perspectives of spirituality and spiritual direction.  This course takes these shifts up while resisting the temptation to collapse the distinctions.    "STH,TY 826,Psychodynamics of Marriage and Family,"This is an introductory course that includes a comprehensive overview of the  field of family systems and  family therapy. This course will serve as an  introduction to the theory and techniques of couples and  family therapy. An  attempt will be made to integrate theory and practice through assignments, class   activities, and personal and professional self-reflection. Students will have  the opportunity to reflect upon  how they might actually use course content  professionally in their respective disciplines.    "STH,TY 828,Womanist Approaches to Religion,"This course will provide students an opportunity to think about how womanist scholars approach the study   of religion and black women's religious experience. We will take up for examination the questions ""what   do womanist scholars mean by womanist approaches to religion?"" And, ""what constitutes religion and   religious experience?"" The course is interdisciplinary and interfaith in its consideration of religion. Students   will be introduced to the methods, aims, approaches, sources and disciplinary locations of womanist   scholarship on religion. Particular attention will be given to the widening scope of womanist research on   religion interms of methodology and religions. The class will engage our concerns through lecture,   discussion and site observations.   "STH,TY 842,Pastoral Psychology of Healing,"Every person, in her or his personal relationships and professional activities,  is guided by a complex, often tacit, theory of healing, comprised of judgments  about illness/suffering (what's wrong?); health/well-being (what's possible?  what's ideal?); the trajectory from one to the other (how do we get there?); and  factors that enhance as well as inhibit movement along that trajectory (what  should we do?).  Examining and comparing a range of theories of healing--in  psychology, medicine, Christian traditions, world religions, and non-Western  cultures--equips us critically to reflect upon, amend, if not reconstruct our  respective theories of healing..    "STH,TY 854,Pastoral Theology and Psychology,"Practical theologians, pastoral theologians, and pastoral psychologists focus on different subject matters, use different methods, and address different audiences. Nonetheless, they share a common purpose to diagnose, accurately and in-depth, concrete problems of the human condition (e.g., suffering, evil) and, correspondingly, to construct effective ways of addressing those problems (i.e., forms of intervention, strategies of care). This is a reading course that examines contributions of theologians, practical theologians, pastoral theologians, and pastoral psychologists, and provides a context in which students may investigate research problems that are especially relevant to their respective communities and traditions, as well as their particular vocational objectives (e.g., parish ministry, chaplaincy, pastoral care, seminary teaching).    "STH,TY 855,"Pastoral Care, Community Justice and Feminist Ethics","Two questions that undergird this course is 1)""what is the relationship between pastoral care and justice  in and for the broader community?"" and 2) ""what do diverse feminist ethical and theological perspectives  contribute this prior question?""  These questions will guide us throughout the semester as we 1) read  diverse perspectives on pastoral care and community justice; 2) visit ministry sites that seek to respond  to various forms of structural, i.e. economic, healthcare; gendered, ethnicity/racial, sexuality, prison,  etc. forms of injustices that impact specific communities; 3) articulate pastoral theologies of care that  explicit integrate ethical commitments to justice and responsible pastoral action; 4) explore the  difference that difference makes in the texts (human narratives as well as those written); 5) interrogate  the exercise of power in unjust social, religious and structural practices and in justice oriented practices  of care.    "STH,TY 857,African American Pastoral Theology,"In this course we will give our attention to the content of African American Pastoral and Practical  Theologies as well as the pastoral practices that emerge from their methods, aims, sources and critiques.   In other words, we want to understand what this contextually based theology means for pastoral leadership  in black contexts.  Specifically, this course privileges African American experience, religion, spirituality and  modes of care.  Finally this course will reconsider what we mean by ""African American Pastoral Theology  and Practical Theology"" as well as the category ""black religion"" by widening the scope of where we look for  African American pastoral contexts. That is, we will include the experiences and voices of those outside the  historical black church congregation.  In doing so, we will consider the question ""does African American  Pastoral theology have currency beyond the black Christian context?""    "STH,TY 864,Pastoral Psychology,"The Self Formulating a model of self that takes into account matters of religion, faith,  and spirituality;    acknowledges the influence of culture, race, ethnicity, class,  and gender; and coordinates the    contributions of various traditions of inquiry.    "STH,TY 870,Pastoral Psychology of Groups,"This course has as its first focus the examination of the kinds of psychodynamics that are a part of group  life, and the implications of these dynamics for participation in, working with, and serving in  pastoral/religious leadership roles with groups in a variety of settings.  This course will introduce students  to the conscious and unconscious dynamics of group life, and therefore, will be concerned with the  transference, countertransference, projection, group identity, and formation, etc.  Additionally, the course  will examine the relationship of race/ethnicity, culture, gender, class and sexuality as embedded and  integral facets of the psychodynamics that shape group processes. Toward these ends, we will engage  psychodynamic theories and concepts concerning the functioning of groups from pastoral psychoanalytic  group perspectives, and consider what they might offer in the service of pastoral practice. Students will  learn experientially about group processes by participating in a small group comprised of members of the  class.      "STH,TY 901,Professional Seminar in Counseling Psychology and Religion,This two-credit graduate level seminar will cover significant issues in the field of Counseling Psychology    and Religion.

In order to gain an  appreciation of the process whereby science is communicated to the public,  attention will also be given to the way in which these scientific papers have  been presented in the magazines and newspapers. During weekend field trips, we  will visit sites where Thoreau's research was carried out; including Walden  Pond, the Minute Man National Historical Site, the Great Meadow Wildlife  Sanctuary, and the Estabrook Woods. Other possible field sites include the Blue  Hills Observatory (origin of the oldest continuous weather records in the U.S.),  the Concord Free Library and the Thoreau Institute (where Thoreau documents are  held), the Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica Plain (where old photographs and plant  specimens are housed), Manomet Bird Observatory (on a day when birds are being  banded), Mt. Auburn Cemetery (where large numbers of bird watchers track bird  movements), and the Massachusetts State Laboratory (where mosquito numbers are  tracked).   "KHC,CM 103,Constant Flux,"Media and Communication from Telegraph to Twitter Students will explore the media environment and analyze the impact of technology  and information on their lives. Studies will highlight the development of  technology over time, assessing how governments, economies and social beliefs  were changed in unexpected ways. Students will perform research that uses  information from their academic majors as a foundation for examining the role  media play in their lives and society. Assessing how the liberal arts, sciences,  business and communication have changed with inventions such as the printing  press, telegraph, television and computers will encourage students to consider  the widespread impact of technology on the historical development of  civilization.  "KHC,EC 102,Blood and Money,"This interdisciplinary seminar will introduce students to the interaction among the promise of science, ethics, and economic reality by focusing on the very specific topic of blood. We will examine an outcome that in one respect was obviously catastrophic. We will seek to understand it from a scientific, historical, and economic perspective. We will study the basic science of two specific blood diseases, sickle cell anemia and hemophilia. We will discuss the history of the development or treatments from those diseases. With respect to the economic perspective, we will analyze the economic forces that caused key players in the historical drama to behave as they did and assess what lessons the episode teaches about the reliance on market outcomes and ways to try to seek to improve upon them.   "KHC,EK 101,Engineering  Light,"Students in this course will gain an appreciation for light and its use in three  optical instruments the eye, the microscope, and the telescope. They will study  landmark discoveries concerning light, the development of various light sources,  the scientific advances that led to our current understanding about the  properties and characteristics of light waves and photons. The course includes  weekly lectures and in-class laboratory exercises, several field trips, and a  semester-long project. Students will engage in more than twenty hands-on  experiments throughout the semester, to untwinkle the stars with adaptive  telescopes, to measure the speed of light using parts hacked from a laser  pointer, to make a light bulb like Thomas Edison's, to discover how engineers  ruined -- and then fixed -- the world's first astronomical space telescope, and  to use a high-resolution ophthalmoscope to see image photoreceptors and  capillary blood flow in their own retinas.  "KHC,HC 301,The Nature of Inquiry,"This course explores how we investigate nature, art, society and their  interconnections. It does so by examining and juxtaposing the practices of three  disciplines history, natural science, and classics. Each section focuses on a  specific problem in one of these fields while also considering the general  questions of what we know, how we know it, and what knowledge means. Throughout  the semester, we consider fundamental ethical, social, and aesthetic issues  posed by the relationship of human beings to each other, nature, and works of  art. The central concern in this class is to understand how and why people make  decisions in complex circumstances; how they take or fail to take responsibility  for their outcomes, and how they respond when gross mistakes are made by others  or indeed by themselves  "KHC,HC 302,The Nature of Inquiry,"Insight & Invention How do different disciplines help us understand society, art, and nature? This  course attempts to bridge the gap between the arts, sciences, and professions,  and between ""pure"" and ""applied"" knowledge by examining the differences and  commonalities of different forms of knowledge. Consisting of six major units  drawn from diverse fields, we focus on how practitioners approach specific  problems in their areas of study. This exploration provides a basis for  confronting the general questions What do we know? How do we know it? What does  knowledge mean? -- Thereby deepening our grasp of various forms of inquiry. "KHC,HC 401,The Process of Discovery,"This one-semester course explores the structure of the discovery process,  focusing on how researchers embed imaginative questions in viable research  projects and balance creative ambition with intellectual modesty. The course is  designed to guide students through the challenge of designing their senior  research projects through common readings of field-changing research across  disciplines, individual and group project analysis, and intensive writing  exercises. Together with KHC faculty and a faculty adviser of their own  choosing, students will learn how to capture the explanatory power of an  imaginative leap in clear language accessible to anyone outside their chosen  discipline   "KHC,HC 501,"Innovation, Culture and Society","In this class we will discuss some of the landmark essays that anticipate and  critique the modern technological and media revolution (McLuhan, Foucault), as  well as identify key historical moments of tension when innovation sparked  important paradigmatic shifts or cataclysmic cultural repercussions (Gutenberg,  Galileo, Oppenheimer). We will extend the discussion to identify key disruptive  moments in business (in automobile manufacturing, regulation of safety  standards, and technology), and relevant global issues by looking at the  accelerated pace of technological change in Asia--using India as an informant-- and its effect on culture. Finally, we will consider two celebrated urban  examples--fin-de-si推祖le Vienna and post-World War II New York--where many lines  of innovation converged, fundamentally changing the culture and society of the  metropolis. As they did in the Junior year KHC HC 401 (The Process of  Discovery), students will work together in small groups to identify and discuss  the ongoing relationship between innovation and culture. They will present their  findings through classroom discussion and written work   "KHC,HC 502,"Innovation, Culture and Society 2",This course builds on the principles and skills developed in KHC HC 501. The   course will center around the completion of the Senior Keystone project.   KHC,HC 503,Keystone,"Innovation, Culture, and Society will be supplemented by a two-credit independent course that students take with their Keystone advisor.  (2 credits, required both semesters)   "KHC,HC 504,Keystone,"Innovation, Culture, and Society will be supplemented by a two-credit independent   course that students take with their Keystone advisor. (2 credits, required both   semester   "KHC,LW 102,"Mar,Fam,Gen","Cannot provide class description."KHC,MU 102,Listening,"This seminar offers an exploration of listening and its mediating practices and  technologies, from the stethoscope to the earbud. Through the lens of recent  theories of listening we begin by considering the way in which our own auditory  habits are socially and culturally determined. We then take a step back to  explore the emergence of the modern listener in the second half of the  nineteenth century and in particular the role of the telephone, phonograph, and  wireless telegraph in shaping a range of new listening practices. We then turn  our attention to the spaces of performance--from the concert hall to the jazz  club--and their associated musical repertories. Here we focus not only on issues  of acoustics, architecture, and social behavior but also on specific musical  compositions and performance traditions that were conceived for these spaces.  Finally, we consider how the advent of recorded sound has changed our  relationship to the way we listen to so-called ""live"" music. In this context we  engage with current debates on the ethics and aesthetics of sound reproduction,  transmission, and ownership. By exploring the public and private spaces in which  listening occurs, we consider the diversity of contemporary and historical  listening practices including the effect of recording technology on recent  performance practice, the relationship between sound and vision, and the way in  which industrial noise has transformed the way in which we hear.   "KHC,NE 102,"Rdg,Lang &Brain","Although we often think of written and spoken language as interchangeable, how  children acquire these two abilities couldn't be more different Children  effortlessly learn to speak and understand language just by listening to it  being spoken around them. On the other hand, becoming an expert reader requires  years of explicit instruction and effortful practice. Some individuals, with a  condition known as developmental dyslexia, will even face a lifelong struggle  with reading difficulties. This course explores the scientific study of reading  and language development -- a richly multidisciplinary effort that bridges the  fields of psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, and education. The emphasis of  this course will be on the modern scientific effort to understand ""the reading  brain"" how learning to read changes our brain in myriad ways, coordinating  neural systems for vision, hearing, language, and memory. Specific topics will  include the history of the alphabet and other writing systems, how different  cultures' writing systems produce different reading brains, how brain injuries  can result in specific impairments in language and reading, and how brain  imaging is helping unravel the mystery of reading impairment.   "KHC,PH 101,American Bioethics,"Bioethics is the systematic study of the moral dimensions of the life sciences  and health care. We will examine various approaches to moral dilemmas, including  deontological, utilitarian, and pragmatic methods, as well as the human rights  and social justice paradigms.  American bioethics is often outcome-oriented, and  reflects and magnifies four deeply-ingrained American characteristics we are  individualistic, technology-driven, death-denying, and wasteful.  These  characteristics make ""reforming"" American healthcare extremely contentious.   This introductory course addresses a wide variety of bioethics challenges in the  context of American life and politics, from assisted conception to assisted  death, from day-to-day medical care to extreme medical research, from brain  death to life-saving organ transplantation, emphasizing how decisions are  actually made in the US medical care setting, and the central roles of informed  consent and legal liability. The Affordable Care Act, especially opposition to  some of its provisions that are grounded in religious freedom, philosophy, and  conscious objection, will be explored.  Trying to understand how American  bioethics ""works,"" and why our ""best in the world"" healthcare system is so  resistant to change, will be constant challenges in this seminar  "KHC,RN 103,Islam in Western Eyes,"The course begins with a discussion of how religion as a category was defined by Europeans and Christians primarily in the 19th century and applied to the study of non-Europeans cultures at the same time.  This discussion of 19th century conceptions of religion is followed by an engagement with the diversity of devotional expressions of Islam, through studies of art, poetry, philosophy, and ethnography. Next, the course will engage the discursive phenomenon of Orientalism and the writings of Orientalists to see when and how these western categories of religion were applied to Muslim beliefs and practices. From there we will examine how Muslims in the modern period responded to modernity and wrote about Islam through similar Orientalist perspectives, which gave rise to political Islamic thought. Finally, we will consider how western political theorists have used these same Orientalist categories of religion to support the theory of an inevitable conflict between the West and Islam in the contemporary period. The course will conclude with criticisms of this ""clash of the civilizations"" theory and reflections on religion in the aftermath of September 11   "KHC,RS 103,History and the Novel,"A series of close readings of major modern works of fiction.  Focus will be on such topics as the novel's effort to speak the truth of history, its status as unintended historical symptom, its occasional conflictual relation with history, its rivalry with music in the effort to distill an essence of time, and the notion of literary history itself.    "KHC,ST 111,Studio I,"The studios foster writing, research, and quantitative skills by exploring fundamental ethical, aesthetic, and social issues. They focus on the themes and problems raised by provocative modernist texts drawn from literature, film, psychology, philosophy, and the arts.    "KHC,ST 112,Studio II,"The studios foster writing, research, and quantitative skills by exploring  fundamental ethical, aesthetic, and social issues. They focus on the themes and  problems raised by provocative modernist texts drawn from literature, film,  psychology, philosophy, and the arts   "KHC,UC 103,Anger,"If Homer's Iliad is the first work of Western literature, as it well may be,  then the first word of Western literature is ""anger.""  Homer begins his epic  with a particular word for anger, ""m推_nis""--it is but one of several ancient  Greek words for this emotion, and means something like righteous anger,  righteous indignation.  That word, and Homer's famous portrayal of its meaning  and effects, will inaugurate our seminar.  Our topic is, in short, just this  anger.  What is it?  How to understand it?  Is it a good thing to feel, or is it  to be suppressed on grounds of irrationality, of its destructiveness, of its  connection with possibly flawed quasi-moral notions such as honor?  We have all  felt anger, to the point that it seems to be an emotion intimately familiar to  us.   And yet we have all wondered at his power and nature, and about its  morality.  Anger certainly seems to be an extraordinarily prevalent and  influential emotion at all levels of human life.     "KHC,VA 101,Art for the City,"Visual Art is a universal language where diverse areas of professional  specialization can intersect and find a new voice and way of speaking to many  people instead of an esoteric and isolated few. Significant social, political,  and moral issues of our time require the ability to think from multiple points  of view. This ability can be developed into a visionary skill, which in turn can  be embodied in enduring and powerful forms of artistic communication. In this  course students will examine the ways that visual art embodies contemporary  issues and how these issues relate to content found in the liberal arts study  disciplines including The Social Sciences, The Natural Sciences, and Life  Sciences. This course will include a diverse range of contemporary practices in  many art forms that we will discuss as a group through frank discourse. We will  investigate the impact of visual arts on diverse domains of 'real world'  industries and communities locally in the Boston Area and compare these with  projects made worldwide. We will do this through lecture presentations, peer to  peer dialogue, student to professional dialogue and research. The course will  culminate with individual illustrated reports in the form of online portfolios.     "KHC,XL 101,Global Shakespeares,"A Kuwaiti playwright, in the aftermath of 9/11, casts Hamlet as a jihadi  terrorist and Ophelia as a suicide bomber.  Hollywood directors set Othello and  Taming of the Shrew adaptations in American high schools.  The College Board, as  it does almost every year, includes a Shakespeare essay on the AP English  Literature exam.   What can these diverse events tell us about the cultures that  produce them and the plays that inspire them?  Why do contemporary writers feel  the need to parrot and parody ""Shakespeare,"" and how much of this activity is  about Shakespeare at all? This seminar provides an introduction to reading and  writing about Shakespeare's plays.  But it also takes a step back to consider  Shakespeare as a phenomenon.  Among others we'll look at feminist Shakespeare,  postcolonial and nationalist Shakespeare, and sci-fi Shakespeare.  Beyond  learning about particular offshoots and adaptations, the deeper point is to make  sure you never read a ""Great Book"" the same way again.     "MED,MS 122,Medical Gross Anatomy,"The BUSM Medical Gross Anatomy course is organized regionally and the content will follow the course of the dissection. The course will first cover Back and Limbs, then Thorax, Abdomen, and Pelvis, and finally Head and Neck.    "MED,MS 123,Medical Histology,"The Medical Histology course covers the study of cell, tissue, organ, and system histology and provides the foundational vocabulary and understanding of normal microscopic structure and organizational concepts required for pathophysiology and clinical medicine. Emphasis is on functional morphology at the light and electron microscope levels.  Directed self-study laboratory exercises and interactive small-group laboratory discussions using computerized virtual microscopy supplement companion lectures. The course runs concurrently with the Medical Physiology and Endocrinology courses in an integrated manner.    "MED,MS 124,Integrated Problems 1A,"Integrated Problems 1A is a small group problem-based learning course in which medical students progressively learn to systematically dissect clinical cases.  The skills developed in this course include integration of concurrent course material and application to a clinical case, creation of research questions from a case presentation, research skills, and succinct presentation skills.  In addition, students progressively develop clinical reasoning skills that will allow them to create differential diagnoses for clinical problems.  Students gain experience working with their colleagues and a faculty member in a respectful manner.      "MED,MS 125,Introduction to Clinical Medicine,"In the fall semester, the Introduction to Clinical Medicine course provides medical students with an opportunity to interview real patients and to observe their peers interviewing patients. Conducting a medical interview is an essential skill for physicians. This course will help medical students learn to develop empathic listening, to establish rapport, and to be able to ask open and closed ended questions. It is also important to learn how to present clinical findings to peers and fourth-year medical students or attending physicians.  In the second semester each first year student spends ten sessions shadowing a clinician-mentor in the ambulatory setting.  The experience is meant to introduce the student to the practice of medicine (broadly defined) and allows the student to practice targeted parts of the medical interview and physical exam. In addition to the clinical sessions, students convene at the medical school for scheduled lectures as well as small group sessions where they focus on more advanced interviewing skills and the introduction to the physical exam.  At the end of the semester they participate in a one case OSCE  (Objective Standardized Clinical Examination)  with a standardized patient where they take a history, do a targeted portion of the physical exam and receive formative feedback.     "MED,MS 126,Human Behavior in Medicine,"This course is designed to provide knowledge of human behavior important to the treatment of patients and their families. While knowledge of disease and its treatment are integral to medical care, understanding the patient as a person who suffers from an illness with his or her own beliefs about the cause and treatment of the illness is part of being an effective physician. Physicians who have an understanding of the aging and dying process can then help patients and their families deal with medical realities. Medical staff who have an awareness of the dynamics of addictions and domestic violence can hone their intuition as to what might assist the individual and the individual's spouse, children and elderly dependents.  In addition, understanding the patient's sexuality gives a more complete medical understanding of the individual.    "MED,MS 127,Biochemistry & Cell Biology,"Biochemistry and Cell Biology provides a great opportunity to study the underlying cellular, biochemical and molecular reactions in the human body. These disciplines allow students to learn how the body works and how alterations in these reactions can lead to a disease state. Such knowledge is essential to becoming an outstanding physician. From a clinical point of view, Biochemistry and Cell Biology provide not only a description of how the physiological system works, but also a foundation for understanding how to improve its operation and potential development of therapeutic and enhanced patient management strategies.    "MED,MS 129,Essentials of Public Health,"The Essentials of Public Health course recognizes that delivering quality healthcare requires extensive knowledge of the health system in which a physician practices. Being an efficient and effective physician will require knowledge of health services, medical economics and ethical, legal, human rights, political and regulatory constraints. Awareness of the environmental and social factors that influence health in individuals and populations is necessary for the promotion of health and the prevention of disease. Caring for patients requires sensitivity to language, culture, race and ethnicity, as well as familiarity with psychosocial and behavioral models. Knowledge of epidemiology and biostatistics is necessary for evaluating effective medical interventions as well as the population basis for the practice of community medicine. A physician will need all of these skills, plus humanity and character, to empathize and care for and about patients.    "MED,MS 130,Medical Genetics,"The pace of genetic advances during the last century has been unparalleled scientifically, and these discoveries have already made and are poised to make an incredible impact on the practice of medicine. Currently, OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) lists over 3600 identified disease genes, and GeneTests lists over 2900 diseases for which there are molecular tests. Moreover, OMIM lists over 21,000 loci that are associated with particular phenotypes. In this course we will explore the precise molecular determinants of medical conditions and of human phenotypic variation that are being elucidated on a daily basis. Clearly, a detailed understanding of the genetic basis of human disease will lead to more precise molecular assays and diagnostics, better-targeted treatments, and more efficient treatment plans overall. Moreover, these developments will certainly affect all clinical specialties of the medical field since genetic components have a clear influence on a wide variety of human traits and conditions, from height and developmental birth defects to cancer susceptibility and neurological degeneration. In this course, we will prepare students to utilize the knowledge of this rapidly developing field in the context of many clinical specialties.     "MED,MS 131,Medical Immunology,"The Medical Immunology course covers key immunologic concepts how the components of the immune system are generated and function; the mechanisms that lead to beneficial immune responses, immune disorders, and immunodeficiencies; methods to identify immune reactions; and ways to manipulate the immune system to benefit the patient. These concepts and related case studies are presented through interactive lectures and small group discussion sessions.   "MED,MS 132,Integrated Problems 1B,See IP 1A Description.    MED,MS 133,Neurosciences,"In this course, students will study a wide variety of Neuroscience disciplines, including Neuroanatomy, Neurophysiology, Neurochemistry, Neuropsychology, and Clinical Neurology. This approach reflects the fact that the study of the brain is an extraordinarily broad field, encompassing many issues and disciplines. The goal of this course is to cover, in an integrated fashion, basic information from all of the disciplines needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the structure and function of the human central nervous system. Neuroanatomy laboratory exercises and neurophysiology discussions supplement lecture material.    "MED,MS 214,Introduction to Clinical Medicine II,"In ICM-2 students learn the parts of the physical examination and hone their interview skills in order to do complete history and physical examinations. Using simulators, models, and standardized patients, students learn to identify heart sounds, perform breast, pelvic, and rectal examinations, and interview patients who have been programmed with substance abuse problems. Along the way they have specialized sessions in diagnostic imaging, cancer screening, and pediatric topics. All students are required to pass the standardized patient physical examination and substance abuse standardized patient exercise, and all must present four complete patient work-ups in standard oral and written format. The course prepares students for the End of Second Year Assessment, a three station clinical OSCE, that takes place in the Clinical Skills and Simulation Center, as well as for the third year clerkships.      "MED,MS 215,Integrated Problems 2A,"Integrated Problems 2A is a course in which students continue to systematically dissect clinical cases, building upon the skills developed during Integrated Problems IA and IB.  In addition to the learning objectives in the first year, by the end of this semester students should be able to differentiate subjective and objective information, identify further clinical data needed to assess a clinical case, and develop assessments and plans for each case.  Students are continually expected to act in a professional and respectful manner of their classmates and their facilitators.    "MED,MS 218,Integrated Problems 2B,"Integrated Problems 2B continues to build on the skills and structure of Integrated Problems IA, IB, and 2A. In this semester students progress through cases more quickly and replace their independent research with research done during their group time.    "MED,MS 220,Dis.& Therapy," The Disease and Therapy (DRx) course integrates the study of disease, including pathophysiology, infectious etiologies, and pharmacologic management in an organ-based context. DRx begins with an introduction to the fundamental concepts of Microbiology, Pathology and Pharmacology in the Foundations Module and is followed by the Infectious Diseases Module in which the microbiological basis of infectious diseases and their pharmacologic treatment is addressed.
