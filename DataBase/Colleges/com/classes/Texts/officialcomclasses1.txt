COM FT 201: Screen Language: The Aesthetics, Grammar and Rhetoric of the Moving Image
	This course is designed to help students communicate through audio, still images   and moving pictures.  We will study how films and photographs of various kinds   communicate ideas, tell stories, and convey artistic expression.  Students will   then be given many opportunities to demonstrate their own grasp of fundaments of   communication and storytelling through images, sounds and montage.  The aim of   this course is not simply to reinforce existing rules but rather to test the   validity of those norms.  Accordingly, students will be asked both to employ and   to violate conventions.  		

COM FT 250: Understanding Film
	Understanding Film will introduce students to key aesthetic aspects of film.   Students will explore a range of styles and genres in film, including narrative  and non-fiction forms, and dominant and alternative styles.  Students will also  study a variety of historical examples of theses different styles that  illustrate the expressive possibilities of image and sound.  Finally, students  will learn to analyze and write about these formal elements, viewing both  complete films and individual sequences.  		

COM FT 303: History of Television
	In this course we will examine the ways in which industrial factors and communication policies have shaped the medium that sits in 99% of U.S. homes.  We will begin by examining television's roots in radio.  The remainder of the course will be broken down into three stages of television history advanced by Rogers, Epstein and Reeves (2002). The first category is TVI- the period of three-network dominance.  The next stage, TVII, is characterized by the rise of cable television and the decentering of the three networks.  We will conclude the course by considering the current stage of television- TV III- in which the era of "on demand" has further destabilized traditional notions of content, audiences, producers, scheduling and technologies.  In addition to tracing this development historically and thematically, we will confront it critically, analyzing the connections between power and money in the medium of television.
