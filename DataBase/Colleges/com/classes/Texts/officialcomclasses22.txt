COM FT 567: Film Styles
	"Style" is a term that crops up routinely in discussions of film, but does it really mean anything? Through the careful study of a broad variety of films, we will compile a catalog of stylistic components which critic and filmmaker alike can use to think more clearly about this slippery concept.
