           			The American television situation comedy has been an enormously popular and  powerful art form.  This course traces the growth of the sitcom genre from the  beginnings in the early 1950's up to the present time and analyzes how American  life has been influenced by it.  We look at how sitcoms affected popular  perception of working class, race, ethnicity, idealized family life and then the  growth of different family structures, fantasy and war.  We study how sitcoms  initially portrayed women and then the emerging changes in response to the  feminist movement.  We analyze Norman Lear's series which talked about the real  things Americans were saying but in the privacy of their homes and the  revolution that his series created.  Finally we examine anti-family satire and  take a close look at contemporary single life, both straight and gay.
