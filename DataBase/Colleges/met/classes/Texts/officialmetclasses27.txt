MET ML 631: Culture and Cuisine: France
	The association between France and fine cuisine seems so "natural."  French society and history are intertwined with the culinary, and have been since the court society of the Old Regime.  After the French Revolution, French cuisine became a truly modern affair in the public sphere.  The invention of the restaurant, the practice of gastronomy, a literature of food, and strong links between French cuisine and national identity all came together in the 19th century.  In the 19th and 20th centuries, French food, featuring both haute cuisine and regional culinary specialties, was widely considered the world?s best. In the 20th century, the culinary allure of France continued to fascinate people all over the world.  It is still said today, enviously, that the French really know how to appreciate good food and wine "la bonne chÃ¨re" in their daily lives.  This course looks at how the history of French culinary culture evolved in the particular way that it did. The course is organized largely chronologically, but not entirely, as some of the readings weave issues of different times periods thematically. In studying culture and cuisine, with France as a great example, we will explore the relationship between a place, a people, and their foodways. We launch our investigation with the question: how and why is this relationship distinctive in France?

	What can food tell us about human culture and social organization?
