Limited enrollment.<br><br> MET EN201 --   Section    Descriptions for Fall 2014<br><br> MET EN201 A1 -- "Multiethnic   American Literature" (Bennett): <br> This course examines the psychological,   political, sociological, and religious concerns of "ethnic" individuals in the   United States in the twenty- and twenty-first centuries and what it means to be   an "American."  We will carefully define "ethnicity" in various literary texts   including a novel, "graphic" books of cartoons, short stories, and poems.  We   will explore works by Native Americans, African Americans, Latin Americans,   Jewish Americans, and Asian Americans.  We will read Art Spiegelman's 'Maus'   (Volumes 1 and 2), John Okada's 'No-No Boy', Junot DÃ­az's 'Drown', Sherman   Alexie's 'The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven', African American   stories, and Arab American poetry.  The humor in a number of these texts   counters the pain described by many of the writers. <br><br> MET EN201 C1 --   "Technology, Ideology and Society" (Grabianowski): <br> Is it possible to create   a sustainable and livable world where equality and human rights are respected?   What, if any, roles do science and technology play in creating such a world?  In   this section of English 201, we will first consider how 19th and 20th century   writers like Nathaniel Hawthorne, Walt Whitman and Aldo Leopold have addressed   the practical and ethical issues that arise out of the intersection of   technology, nature and society. We will then explore through topics like   sustainable business models, ecological economics, big data, agribusiness and   genetics how contemporary scientists, technology industry leaders, and writers   like Jacob Bronowski, Bill Joy, Michael Pollan and Herman Daly continue to   grapple with the rapid transformation of our technological existence. <br><br>  MET EN201 D1 -- "The Lost Generation" (Jackson):<br> This class explores the   writers of the Lost Generation, American expatriates in Europe in the 1920's and   1930's. These include some of the most important and most popular of all   American writers. The readings include Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, T. S. Eliot's   The Waste Land, Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises, and F. Scott Fitzgerald's   Tender Is the Night. Our research will examine these works in the contexts of  World War I, growing  social and political revolutions, changes in the roles of  men and women, the  psychologies of both Freud and "shell-shock," contrasts  between Europe and  America, the economics of a stock market boom and the Great  Depression, and the  challenges of Modernism in art. <br><br>
