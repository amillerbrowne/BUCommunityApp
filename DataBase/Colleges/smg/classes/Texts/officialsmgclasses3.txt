GSM MF 600: Math Refresher
	The Mathematical Finance Program has a very strong quantitative component, one   which many incoming students underestimate. Although students admitted to the   program have satisfied the prerequisites in Mathematics, the program's   prerequisites represent the minimal, not the optimal, background required. Even   if you have learned the topics required as prerequisites, reviewing these   concepts immediately prior to the start of the program could be enormously   helpful and will certainly increase your chance of success in the program. The   course will begin with a review of matrix algebra, then proceed to examine the   role of calculus in comparative static analysis. Following this, unconstrained   and constrained optimization will be covered using multivariate calculus. The   second half of the class deals with dynamics, beginning with a review of   integration, and continuing with first- and higher-order differential equations. 		

GSM MF 601: Preparation Week
	Mathematical Finance Preparation Week is a combination of orientation activities,   academic sessions, and career preparation designed to give you a foundational   knowledge for the Mathematical Finance program. The week will include training on   various tools you will need for the program, professional development sessions,   and social gatherings.

The Career Preparation Module will teach students necessary  communication skills for successful interviewing to leverage internship and full  time opportunities. It will also help them identify their role in the industry,  teach them how to establish a target list of companies and contacts, and guide  them through how to strategically position themselves and their unique value  through their personal brand.		

GSM MG 600: MBA Orientation
	Required orientation for all incoming M.B.A. students.		

GSM MG 700: Ethical and Global Foundations
	This experience, delivered during the pre-semester, will deliver ethical and global foundations which provide students a broad exposure to concepts that will be applied throughout the MBA experience. The foundation contains two courses. First, an intensive three day course - Ethics, Values, and Responsibility -- is designed to lay a conceptual foundation, introduce frameworks, provide a common language for ethics and ethical decision-making, and provoke awareness of one's values and ethical frontier to help guide principled thought and analysis. Second, Global Foundations will expose students to the complexities of operating in a global environment, discuss challenges associated with globalization, consider strategic factors when approaching global business problems, gain understating of global institutions, and provide a foundation on approaching country contexts. Synergies across both courses will emerge to provide students a strong foundation as they enter their core coursework.		

GSM MG 790: Ethical Leadership in a Global Economy
		Ethical Leadership in a Global Economy will provide students with a unique 2nd year learning experience on how the global economy is transforming economic sectors, presenting new risks, calling forth innovation, and challenging traditional values and norms.  Through engagement with select firms, governmental, and civil society organizations, students will develop an appreciation of how new realities challenge traditional business integrity, strategy, and values in the global economy.  Course projects and content will include both sector and functional based experiences. This course will provide opportunity for students to apply concepts which have been building through the pre-term, core, and professional skills courses. 		

GSM MG 800: Variable Credit

GSM MK 841: Customer-Driven Growth Strategies
		Because companies face constant pressure to develop markets -- both existing and  new -- to feed demands for growth, we propose a course that would equip MBA  students with a nimble yet robust approach to identify, quantify and leverage  opportunities that facilitate growth. This course proposal comprises  experiential "modules" that are based on real-world scenarios designed in  collaboration with corporate executive partners (e.g., BU alumni, recruiters,  major area employers, network contacts). Modules pose growth challenges partners  have experienced in the sectors of (1) healthcare and pharmaceuticals, (2)  digital, (3) retail and (4) consumer-packaged goods.		

GSM MK 845: Social Media Marketing
		Social media technologies are continuously transforming the ways consumers  interact with each other and firms. These changes constitute a fundamental shift  in the marketplace--consumers have greater opportunities to voice their opinions  and connect with other consumers as well as increased influence over marketers  and brands. In this course, we examine how organizations capitalize on social  media and these consumer-to-consumer interactions to support their marketing  efforts. Specifically, we'll examine (a) how social media can be used to listen  to consumers and monitor their behavior; (b) developing and delivering content  that engages consumers; and (c) how to track the effectiveness of these efforts.  Finally, we'll explore how to manage both the internal and external dimensions  of social media engagement. We view these issues from a strategic and a  practical perspective, rather than a technical or platform perspective.  We  examine these topics using a hands-on approach, including live cases, personal  engagement in social media, and a team project.		

GSM MK 849: Debiasing Decision Making
		The objective of this course is to inform future managers, consultants, and advisors of the psychological processes and biases underlying the decisions made by customers, competitors, colleagues, and themselves, with emphasis on how to incorporate such insights into marketing and business strategies.  Applications of these processes and biases will be examined within the domains of the sustainability and health sectors.  The course will provide students with a broad overview of important results from various behavioral sciences (e.g., behavioral decision research, cognitive and social psychology, behavioral economics, consumer research) that demonstrate the several biases that can affect the quality of our strategic decisions. It is intended to provide students with knowledge about applying these findings to topics in marketing, strategic management, and organizational behavior.  Classroom time will be devoted to a combination of lectures, discussions, cases, and exercises illustrating the main concepts.
