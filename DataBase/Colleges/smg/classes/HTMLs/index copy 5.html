	<h4>Managing and Improving Quality: Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Certification</h4>
	<p class="meta">GSM OM 840 (3 credits)</p>
	<p>Lean and Six Sigma are powerful improvement methodologies that promote process  improvement, cost reduction and significant enhancement of bottom-line  profitability. The purpose of this course is to thoroughly examine the concept  of quality, to define it in terms that are useful for managers, to survey the  ideas of major quality thinkers and theorists, to develop proficiency in the use  of quality tools, and to consider the challenges of quality program  implementation in real business situations. Throughout the course we will  investigate similarities and differences between quality management in  manufacturing and service contexts. The course has three major objectives. The  first goal is to define quality and explore important philosophies and useful  frameworks for managers or consultants. The second goal is to focus on the Lean  and Six Sigma tools available for the pursuit of lasting quality improvements.  The third is to bring the experiences of Lean Six Sigma practice into the  classroom. We'll benefit from the expertise and experience of Lean and Six Sigma  professionals who will help us to understand the challenges of Lean and Six  Sigma implementations and analyze the lessons they have learned from projects  they have undertaken.</p>

	<h4>Clean Technologies and Supply Chains</h4>
	<p class="meta">GSM OM 845 (3 credits)</p>
	<p>The clean technology industry is one of the largest sectors of the economy and  yet still undergoing significant growth and attracting a plethora of new  entrants. It has been characterized by a great deal of experimentation around  new technologies and around business models in the face of regulatory and market  place disruptions. The course uses a combination of cases, simulation and  analytical exercises to review trends and their co-evolution within the clean  technology/energy eco-system. It aims to build a skill set around risk and  opportunity assessment, and allied implementation challenges. This course is  aligned with the requirements of the Entrepreneurship, PNP and Strategy  concentrations.</p>

	<h4>Supply Chain Management</h4>
	<p class="meta">GSM OM 854 (3 credits)</p>
	<p>This course presents tools and modeling frameworks that are relevant to solving  today's supply-chain problems. The class will offer a mixture of case  discussions, lectures, games, and outside speakers. Case discussions will cover  subjects including designing new-product supply chains, optimizing inventory  levels, quick response, the role of B2B exchanges, and managing capacity for  short life-cycle products. Games, including the distribution game, the OPT game,  and the Beer Game, will reinforce the concepts in a constructive way. Finally,  outside speakers will present real-world examples of how supply-chain models are  being deployed in practice. This course is for students who will be working in  consulting or supply-chain management. For those interested in finance or  marketing, the course provides solid exposure to an area that is integral to  product-focused companies.</p>

	<h4>Idea Lab</h4>
	<p class="meta">GSM OM 865 (3 credits)</p>
	<p>This is an experiential course aimed at developing ideas for digital products  and services ("web services"), within the context of a multi-stage "innovation  tournament." The tournament structure will force the screening of certain ideas  in the initial stages, and in such cases, some students will get reassigned to  the surviving ideas. Participants will learn specific tools, methods, and  concepts related to the creation of such services (e.g., opportunity sensing,  management of variation, innovation/business analytics, crowd sourcing vs out  sourcing decisions, existing versus incremental enabling technologies, idea  interdependence and information architecture, task sequencing for enhancing  cycle time and service quality) and will be required to develop web based test  tools. The instructor anticipates that the best performing ideas will have high  potential for entrepreneurial development. Thus, this course can serve as a  front end to conduct follow-on development by working either in the IS,  operations, health sector management, energy or entrepreneurship concentration  courses, and/or by working with affinity groups in the BU community, such as,  ITEC.   Participants will be expected to read assigned material on visualization of  ideas, and engage in the generation of promising ideas prior to starting this  class. Make sure you have basic familiarity with how the web works. You need not  be technical, nor have deep experience with the web development. Rather, you  simply should understand the basic ideas behind URLs, HTML, and how web browsers  work. You can figure this out by reading the Wikipedia entry  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web). We will also provide you with a  mock-up of a typical website along with a tutorial on how to upload and edit  this web site.</p>

	<h4>Introduction to Business Law</h4>
	<p class="meta">GSM PL 700 (2 credits)</p>
	<p>This course will survey contemporary issues in selected areas of law and ethics. We will introduce pivotal areas of law, so that students begin to anticipate legal problems, analyze how to avoid them, and realize how legal principles can be employed to add value in their chosen fields. The subjects are torts, contracts, employment law, securities regulation and corporate governance. We expect that this overview of a few disciplines will encourage students to explore other legal topics relevant to their business interests. We will also offer an analytic structure that enables students to identify ethical issues in business, analyze options and make choices consistent with their own values.</p>

	<h4>Macroeconomics in the Global Environment</h4>
	<p class="meta">GSM PL 834 (3 credits)</p>
	<p>Macroeconomics is the study of the aggregate behavior of global market  participants, i.e. consumers, firms, workers, governments, central banks,  foreign investors. Decision making by investment bankers, product/sales  managers, policy makers, or consumers inevitably rely on an understanding of the  main forces driving GDP, inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and exchange  rates. Consider these questions:  1. Should new consumer durable products be  launched during recessions? 2. Are countries that experience high productivity  growth good investment targets? 3. Will interest rates drop if the US government  starts buying back its debt? 4. With significant liquidity demands by the US  economy from the public sector, the household sector and businesses, what  explains the low US interest rates? Are these factors expected to keep interest  rates low also in the future? 5. Can the Euro boost productivity in Europe in  the medium to long run and what are the competitiveness challenges for US  businesses of such changes?  6. What are the economic effects of wars and how  should they be financed?  These and other issues will come up in the course. The  main goal of this course is to provide a coherent framework that you can use to  understand economic events as you confront them in your work environment.</p>

	<h4>Strategic Fundraising and Corporate Philanthropy</h4>
	<p class="meta">GSM PL 837 (3 credits)</p>
	<p>This course is designed to help students develop a sophisticated understanding  of the field of philanthropy and its role in building successful nonprofit  organizations.  The course is designed for students who want to become effective  nonprofit managers and development professionals, securing financial resources  for charitable organizations from foundations, corporations, and individuals.   It is also designed to help students become thoughtful stewards of philanthropic  funds as a foundation trustee or program officer, corporate giving officer, or  individual philanthropist. Accordingly, the course will alternately adopt the  perspective of the grant-seeker and the grant-maker.  This approach will help  prepare future leaders in the field, whether providers of funding or applicants  for it, to understand the current and historical context of their work and to  ask the right questions of prospective funders, prospective grantees, and their  own organizations.  The course will consider diverse viewpoints on philanthropy  and explore some alternatives to traditional grant-making.</p>

	<h4>Emerging Issues in Business and Law</h4>
	<p class="meta">GSM PL 861 (3 credits)</p>
	<p>You ask your outside lawyer or your company's legal department whether you can undertake some activity without violating the law.  You are annoyed when you are told "Well, maybe.  It depends".  You want a yes-or-no answer, not a game of twenty questions.  Why can't your lawyers give you a straight answer?  Why do they make everything more complicated?  What language are they speaking?  Most business people ask these questions.  If you do business you cannot avoid dealing with lawyers.  You can allow your interactions with lawyers to frustrate you, or you can learn how lawyers think so that you can better manage them.  Emerging Issues in Business Law introduces graduate business students to fundamentals of legal analysis by focusing on timely legal problems of particular interest to business.  Students develop familiarity with substantive legal principles and leave the course with the ability to recognize legal issues, discuss them intelligently, and understand why the lawyers seem incapable of giving a simple answer.  The course uses lectures to provide a common foundation of knowledge.  It is primarily discussion based, using a question and answer format to engage students in the process of legal analysis.</p>

	<h4>Managing Political, Economic, Social, and Technology and Country Risk</h4>
	<p class="meta">GSM PL 864 (3 credits)</p>
	<p>This case-based course introduces students to conceptual tools and frameworks that allow them to think systematically about environmental changes that restructure companies, industries, and countries, preparing them to deal with those changes. The course explores political, economic, technological, and social change, as well as natural disasters and political risk. Students will map the flow of events and experiences that shape political or business leaders' attitudes and will be introduced to the analyses of countries, systems, trends, stakeholders, scenario developments, cross-impact, and payoff assessments. They will assess probable shifts in stakeholder power within the industry or country and suggest potentially successful leadership and change strategies.</p>
