			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/smg/courses/smg-si-451/"><strong>SMG SI 451: Organizing for Design and Innovation</strong></a><br>
			            <span>Undergraduate Prerequisites: SMG FE323, SMG IS323, SMG MK323, and SMG OM323; or SMG SI480.</span><br>
                            			This course examines how managers and leaders can create the conditions for innovation at the individual, team and organizational levels and how those conditions differ for startup and mature organizations.

			            			Can firms increase both environmental performance and profitability? Sometimes,  but not always. In this course, we consider how and when firms can respond  to growing demands for improved environmental performance and disclosure (from  customers, NGO, activists, and regulators) in a way that also improves the long  term financial performance of the firm. Through case studies and current news  articles across a variety of contexts (consumer products, food services, energy  service companies, and renewable energy), mini-lectures, and a team project  working with the BU Sustainability Office, this course provides exposure to many  topics related to sustainability and provides hands-on experience with the  analytical tools and thinking required to evaluate the business case for  sustainability.		</li></div><div class="last column" style="width: 48%; float: left;"><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/smg/courses/smg-si-469/"><strong>SMG SI 469: Real Estate Development</strong></a><br>
			            <span>Undergraduate Prerequisites: SMG FE 323 ; SMG IS 323 ; SMG MK 323 ; SMG OM 323.</span><br>
                            			Real estate development is a process rather than a product. Too often, assumptions about occupancy, market absorption, rental income growth, valuation and competition are based on guesswork and interest in specific product types. The course reviews the underlying demographic market data that drives demand; utilizing data such as population and job growth, market and marketability analysis. The focus then shifts to site selection and feasibility analysis, the available methods of gaining site control and the process of assembling the professional team. Later, the course reviews the regulatory control process, along with budgeting and contract award and review of the construction control processes. The course is introductory in nature and assumes students have little or no knowledge about the development process. 4 cr.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
