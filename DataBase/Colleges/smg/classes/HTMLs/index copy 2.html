                			This intensive ten day seminar provides students with a broad understanding of  the ways in which business strategies can create value at the base of the  economic pyramid.* Students will gain first hand experience of how businesses,  NGOs (non-governmental organizations), and government are using models of social  enterprise to address social and economic issues in the fields of health,  education, and the environment in the context of an emerging market - in this  case, Brazil.  This study program includes extensive site visits throughout the  country to social enterprises, multi-national firms, NGO ventures, and  government organizations. Students also hear from a wide variety of Latin  American specialists in topic areas. A broad range of topics will be covered  including: renewable energy, sustainable development, eco-tourism, new models  for providing health and education services to underserved populations, social  enterprise, micro-enterprise, corporate social responsibility, and  public/private partnerships. The course will consist of three pre-departure  sessions focused on social enterprise, corporate social responsibility, and  emerging markets. Students are also expected to select an individual research  track of interest for the duration of the seminar. This seminar is open to all  full time and part time MBA and MS.MBA students. Full time students may register  for it as a spring elective, part time students can register for it as they see  fit, students graduating in May can register for this class in the Spring and  still participate in commencement ceremonies, and MS.MBA students may take it in  year two. *In global terms, this is the four billion people who live on less  than $2 per day. The phrase "bottom of the pyramid" is used in particular by  people developing new models of doing business that deliberately target that  market, typically using new technology.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
