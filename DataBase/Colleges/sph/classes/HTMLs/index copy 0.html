			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-bs-854/"><strong>SPH BS 854: Bayesian Methods in Clinical Trials</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH BS851 or BS861 or consent of instructor</span><br>
                			Bayesian statistical methods use prior information or beliefs, along with the current data, to guide the search for parameter estimates. In the Bayesian paradigm probabilities are subjective beliefs. Prior information/ beliefs are input as a distribution, and the data then helps refine that distribution. The choice of prior distributions, posterior updating, as well as dedicated computing techniques are introduced through simple examples. Bayesian methods for design, monitoring analysis for randomized clinical trials are taught in this class. These methods are contrasted with traditional (frequentist) methods. The emphasis will be on concepts. Examples are case studies from the instructors' work and from medical literature. R will be the main computing tool used.		</li><li class="dontsplit">

                			The purpose of this course is to present Bayesian modeling techniques in a variety of data analysis applications, including both hypothesis and data driven modeling. The course will start with an overview of Bayesian principles through simple statistical models that will be used to introduce the concept of marginal and conditional independence, graphical modeling and stochastic computations. The course will proceed with the description of advanced Bayesian methods for estimation of odds and risk in observational studies, multiple regression modeling, loglinear and logistic regression, latent class modeling including hidden Markov models and application to model-based clustering, graphical models and Bayesian networks. Applications from genetics, genomics, and observational studies will be included. These topics will be taught using real examples, class discussion and critical reading. Students will be asked to analyze real data sets in their homework and final project. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-bs-856/"><strong>SPH BS 856: Adaptive Designs for Clinical Trials</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH BS851</span><br>
                			An adaptive design is a clinical trial design that allows modification to aspects of the trial after its initiation without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial. Adaptive designs have become very popular in the pharmaceutical industry because they can increase the probability of success, considerably reduce the cost and time of the overall drug development process. With a recent rapid development in this area, there is a high demand for statisticians proficient in designing and conducting adaptive clinical trials. Students will learn different (both frequentist and Bayesian) adaptive designs and gain hands-on experiences on adaptive randomization, adaptive dose-finding, group sequential, and sample-size reestimation designs.		</li></div><br style="clear: both;"></ul>
