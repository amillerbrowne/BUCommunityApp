			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-ph-709/"><strong>SPH PH 709: The Biology of Public Health</strong></a><br>
			            			This course, designed for students who have little or no background in the biological sciences, provides a foundation in the biological mechanisms and principles underlying major public health problems.  Selected public health problems are explored from a biological perspective in order to provide fundamental information about infectious and non-infectious agents of disease, disease transmission, biological defense mechanisms, co-evolution of man and microbes, the effects of nutritional deficiency and excess, effects of respiratory exposures, the biology of cancer, aging, and other topics.  Each student completing this course should be able to knowledgeably participate in a discussion of public health problems with a basic understanding of the terminology, the underlying biological mechanisms of major public health problems, the biological impact of disease, and the major biological issues that influence the success of interventions. This course, or its equivalent, or SPH EH710, Physiology, are required pre-requisites for SPH EH768, Introduction to Toxicology.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-ph-712/"><strong>SPH PH 712: Public Health Response to Emergencies in the United States</strong></a><br>
			            			This course provides students with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand the public health impacts and roles during emergencies and disasters in the United States.  The course will use two recent cases, 2013 Boston marathon bombing and 2009-2010 pandemic flu, to explore the persons, events, decisions, policies, and systems involved in each of the events. Students will apply emergency preparedness skills to analyze preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation operations and to communicate risk effectively. Students  will consider the question that plagues governmental authorities and residents alike: ARE WE READY? In the end, students will possess a command over how the public health system can provide essential services and support healthy communities during times of emergency. This is accomplished through a combination of case studies, panel discussions, team activities, tours, and exercises. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-ph-728/"><strong>SPH PH 728: Religion, Ethics, and Public Health</strong></a><br>
			            			This course will introduce students to the health related aspects of a variety of Western and Eastern religious and ethical traditions, health controversies that exist within those traditions, methods that can be used to reconcile public health needs with religious and ethical traditions. Through review of case studies, students will be challenged to harmonize public health priorities with cultural beliefs in a way that best serves the community. For example, we will study the religious and ethical controversy inherent in major public health issues such as exemptions to mandatory vaccination laws, sex education in public schools, statues outlawing female genital cutting, life support withdrawal, determination of death, faith healing, fetal stem cell research and allocation of scarce resources. Ultimately, students will generate a robust conceptual framework, enabling a nuanced approach to some of the most critical topics in the field of public health.		</li><li class="dontsplit">

                			The goal of this course is to give students a basic understanding of the human and environmental factors involved in the natural history of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.  Specific infectious diseases, including avian influenza, SARS, dengue, chikungunya, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli, will be employed as models to illustrate the involvement of these factors.  Major emphasis will be placed on understanding the pathogenesis of the specific infectious diseases under discussion, as such an understanding is essential for appreciating how any disease emerges or re-emerges.  At the conclusion of the course, students will be able to apply the principles they have learned to analyze and determine the factors involved in the new emergence or re-emergence of an infectious disease; knowledge which is ultimately essential for determining appropriate disease control and prevention strategies. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-ph-851/"><strong>SPH PH 851: Needs Assessment</strong></a><br>

			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-ph-853/"><strong>SPH PH 853: Strategic Planning and Communications</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: For DrPH students</span><br>
                			This course focuses on the development and implementation of program and policy interventions that can improve public health by modifying people's health-related behaviors, and on the design and execution of effective oral and written communications to support those interventions. Working through a sequence of written assignments, students will develop: (1) a set of theory-based learning and environmental change objectives; (2) a strategic plan for a program or policy intervention designed to change an important health-related behavior; (3) a management plan for implementing and maintaining that intervention; (4) a supportive communication strategy; and (5) specific media and communications executions to operationalize that strategy. In class writing workshops and individual consultations are designed to give students ideas for their projects and interim feedback on their written assignments. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-ph-854/"><strong>SPH PH 854: Program and Policy Evaluation</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: DrPH students; other students only with consent of instructor.</span><br>
                			Evaluation research is critical to the advancement of public health knowledge and the improvement of program services. This course focuses on the theory and practice of program evaluation and the development of student evaluation skills and their implementation in practice. Students will use case study materials.  Students will learn to conceptualize the entire evaluation process from the development of program logic, through evaluation design, measurement, sample size calculation and an analysis plan. In addition, students will learn about cost-effectiveness analysis and meta-analysis for policy development. PH854 is a summer-long course.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-ph-856/"><strong>SPH PH 856: Law &amp; Ethics for Public Health Leaders</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: DrPH students and other students with instructor consent only</span><br>
                			Law, ethics, and human rights often either determine or heavily influence both the range of choices open to public health policymakers and the means available to achieve public health goals. Using case studies, including rationing flu vaccine, responding to catastrophes such as Hurricane Katrina, protecting and promoting women?s health and reproductive rights in developing countries, and regulating research to prevent exploitation of subjects in resource poor countries, students will recognize and integrate legal, ethical, and human rights concepts into public health policy development. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-ph-857/"><strong>SPH PH 857: Health Economics and Financial Management for Public Health</strong></a><br>

			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH PH853 or permission of instructors</span><br>
                			This course will focus on developing tools for and perspectives on decision- making in senior public health positions through analysis of a series of case studies. Students will adopt different roles in preparing the cases, sometimes singly and sometimes in groups. The cases will address challenges faced by senior leadership including human resources, facilities design, quality control, organizational change and integration of policy and program planning. Students will be assessed on: (1) memos prepared for their roles in individual classes; (2) the quality of their participation in class discussions of the cases; and (3) their response to a case that will be distributed as a final examination.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
