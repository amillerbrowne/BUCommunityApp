			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH PM702</span><br>
                			This course provides students with the knowledge and skills to evaluate and manage information technology in heath care organizations. In particular it focuses on the role of IT in driving organizational change and supporting quality improvement and elimination of medical errors. Topics include electronic health records, computerized provider order entry, interoperability, management decision support, and provider pay for performance. The perspective of the course is that of the chief information officer (CIO) and other managers and users of health care information systems, not that of the technical specialist. The course will consist of a series of lectures, cases, and discussions, some of which will be led by guest lecturers who are experts in the field of health care information technology and systems. Course requirements include a quiz, a 10-page paper, and a class presentation. The class meets at the Charles River Campus with GSM HM817 on the GSM schedule. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-821/"><strong>SPH PM 821: Advanced Health Services Research Methods</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: BS723 or consent AND PM811</span><br>
                			This course builds on SPH PM811 by providing advanced methods and their applications to studies of health care outcomes, quality, and economics. Methods covered include: advanced measurement techniques such as item response theory and applications through computer adaptive testing, selecting the research design, meta-analysis, advanced statistics applied to grant proposals, and econometric methods using instrumental variables. Students develop an original paper based upon a secondary data analysis.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-824/"><strong>SPH PM 824: Theory &amp; Research on Organizations</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: MS or PhD candidate in health services research degree program or consent</span><br>
                			The purposes of this course are first to develop the students' understanding of major theoretical perspectives on health care organizations, and second to develop their abilities to apply these theories to conduct theory-based research on health care organizations. The course achieves this understanding through an in-depth review of contemporary literature addressing each major theoretical perspective and through written assignments and discussions of the contrasts among the major theoretical perspectives on organizations. To develop their abilities to apply the theories, students also design organizational research based upon the different theories. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-826/"><strong>SPH PM 826: Health, Illness, and the Use of Health Services</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: PM814 or consent</span><br>
                			This course provides an introduction to social science research relating to patients' engagement with health services.  Its goal is to develop critical understandings of how people perceive a need for health services, seek them, engage in transactions with health care providers as "patients" and live with the outcomes of care.  The central theme is patient-centered health care as a basis for inquiry in health economics (e.g., consumer behavior, decision making) and health care quality and outcomes (e.g., approaches to chronic illness care, shared decision making). 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-827/"><strong>SPH PM 827: Strategic Management of Healthcare Organizations</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH PM702 or IH704 or SAR HP353 (for non-concentrators)</span><br>
                			This course examines key strategic issues that healthcare organizations face that affect their competitive position and performance. Through the course students learn to select and apply analytic frameworks from economics, management, and law to resolve these strategic issues. Students develop skills in strategic planning and management that includes industry and competitive analysis. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-828/"><strong>SPH PM 828: Advanced Seminar in Qualitative Research Methods for Health Services Research</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH SB818 or GMS MA 710 or consent of instructor.</span><br>
                			This course will focus on the use of qualitative methods in understanding outcomes of care, such as patient-centered perspectives on illness and health care; processes of care, such as doctor-patient interactions and communication; and the organization of care, such as the impact of different organizational structures on the quality of care. Students will develop skills in the use of qualitative methods in health services research, including the procedures of focus groups, the use of in-depth interviews, naturalistic observations of health care practices, and ethnographic studies of health care organizations and client communities. The course is part of the PhD program in Health Services Research, but will be of interest to other students who wish to learn about utilizing qualitative methods in their research. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-830/"><strong>SPH PM 830: Developing Patient-Based Health Status and Outcomes Measures</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH PM811 or consent</span><br>
                			Contemporary health services research relies heavily on patient-based measures of health status and other outcomes of health care. This course covers development and application of health status constructs to be measured, scope and content of questionnaires, qualitative and quantitative methods of scale development and validation, and new assessment methodologies including Item Response Theory and Computer Adapted Testing.  Practical issues of deciding if and when to develop a new measure, as well as selecting and applying measures in designing health outcomes research are addressed.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-831/"><strong>SPH PM 831: Implementation Research and Implementation Science: Conceptual Basis for Linking Research and Practice in Health Services Research</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH BS704 and SPH SB818 or equivalent</span><br>
                			A major gap exists in health services research between what is known about interventions and the actual use of those interventions in practice. Often, interventions shown effective in the research setting do not translate in the real world. Implementation science focuses on developing methods to ensure that evidence‐based models are effectively translated to the clinical setting. The course focuses on the complex concepts of implementation science, including the wide range of theoretical frameworks and approaches driving the field. Students will also learn about different models of implementation research, its strengths and limitations, and develop an implementation research study proposal. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-832/"><strong>SPH PM 832: Operations Management in Health Care</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: PM702 or IH704 and the biostatistics core course requirement.</span><br>
                			This course is designed to focus on the field of operations management (OM) in healthcare. Students will learn to apply OM principles to develop more effective operational processes, mitigate risks, and improve quality. Discussions from the text, case studies and assignments will focus on strategies and techniques of quality improvement processes, project management, work-flow and system design, and capacity planning. Additionally students will explore the intricacy, complexity and dynamics of logistics in healthcare. An industry based project will enable students to engage and implement several of the tools learned in class.		</li></div><div class="last column" style="width: 48%; float: left;"><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-833/"><strong>SPH PM 833: Health Economics</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH PM702 or consent of instructor.</span><br>
                			This course develops the tools of basic microeconomic analysis and applies them to key health policy issues. It emphasizes the trade-offs involved in various choices within the health care economy, with particular attention to examination of issues related to the debate between pro-market and government regulatory approaches to health care policy. Topics include the role of risk and uncertainty in health and health care, the industrial organization of the health care sector, and how payment systems affect the incentives and behavior of patients, insurers, and providers. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-834/"><strong>SPH PM 834: Health Regulation and Planning</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH PM702 or consent of instructor.</span><br>
                			Failures of competitive markets in health care have sparked public planning and regulation. But these, in turn, have not been very successful in addressing problems of access, cost, appropriateness/quality, or caregiver configuration.  Examining cases of persisting health problems such as childhood lead poisoning and quality of nursing home care, this course dissects what has worked and why.  We examine ways to quantify harm caused by a problem, analyze causes of the harm, develop policies and programs to address those causes, and analyze the efficacy, cost, political feasibility, and managerial feasibility of specific programs.  Each student prepares a realistic plan to ameliorate harm to people's health caused by a persisting threat.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-835/"><strong>SPH PM 835: Lean Management in Healthcare</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: PM702 or IH704 and the biostatistics core course are required.</span><br>
                			This course is designed to prepare students to plan and successfully implement lean management driven processes in health care organizations. It teaches lean principles and provides the opportunity to complete a lean managed project. It therefore uses a blended format that includes a week long intensive program for training on lean concepts and tools, followed by a semester long field work on a quality improvement project using lean methodology with online and personal support. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-837/"><strong>SPH PM 837: Evaluating Health Care Quality</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH PM702 or PM814 or consent of instructor.</span><br>
                			The purpose of this class is to provide a scientific basis to quality measurement.  Topics include reliability and validity of measures, implicit versus explicit reviews, provider profiling, and the role of risk-adjustment.  The course also covers applications of quality measures in health care today. Examples are drawn from various settings including acute care, long-term care, and ambulatory care. Readings are mostly based on articles in the health services research literature.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-838/"><strong>SPH PM 838: Health Politics and Policy</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH PM702.</span><br>
                			This course is designed to help students understand political dynamics of health policy making at the state level and to develop practical skills required for effective work as policy advocates.  Analytic models, case studies, guest speakers, and in-class exercises promote a practical understanding of how ideas succeed, or fail, to become law.   		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-840/"><strong>SPH PM 840: Analysis of Current Health Policy Issues</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH PM702 and the biostatistics and epidemiology MPH core course requirements.</span><br>
                			The purpose of this course is to arm students with the skills to debate, define, and defend health policy proposals. We will explore, in depth, several current health policy problems. The course will take an analytic case approach, identifying policy options and tools, then gathering information and applying data to evaluate outcomes, costs; winners and losers. Methods for finding and accessing information on the Internet are emphasized. This is a capstone course meant to be taken in the student's last semester. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-842/"><strong>SPH PM 842: Health Economics for Health Services Research</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH PM702 or PM814, one semester of calculus or consent of instructor.</span><br>
                			This course provides an understanding of principles of microeconomics and applied microeconomic analysis of public health policy issues sufficient to comprehend and conduct health services research. The over-arching philosophical issues facing the post health care reform world and the arguments defining the debate between pro-market and government regulatory approaches are addressed. The main focus is on domestic health economics; however, analytic methods developed in the course are applicable to foreign health care systems. Students may not take both PM833 and PM842 for degree credit.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-850/"><strong>SPH PM 850: Consumer Organizing and Advocacy for Health System Change</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: None.</span><br>
                			We are at an exciting point in the evolution of health care reform. As the focus for system delivery reform begins to value quality and cost transparency, consumers and patients could be left on the side lines. This course offers students the opportunity to tackle a persistent health care problem of their choosing, the solution for which, will move patients and consumers closer to the center of our delivery system. Students will create a framework for a consumer-led campaign by crafting strategic tools, proposing media and communication plans and writing a memo that can be used as a pitch to potential funders. This is a dynamic class that values class participation. Students will work in groups and will be invited to tackle problems such as: patient engagement and empowerment in a reformed payment system; health literacy and education for non-English speakers; implementation of the Affordable Care Act; and implementation of comprehensive payment reform.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-855/"><strong>SPH PM 855: Cost Effectiveness Analysis and Decision Analysis</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH BS703 and PM814. Students may not take PM807 and PM855 for degreecredit.</span><br>
                			This course offers an introduction to the uses and conduct of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) as decision making aids in the health and medical fields. It provides students with an understanding of the roles and limitations of CEAs and criteria for evaluating these studies. Important theoretical and practical issues encountered in measuring costs and effectiveness, evaluating outcomes, discounting, and dealing with uncertainty are discussed. Discussions on framing and reporting of CEAs focus on the purpose of the analysis and the effective communication of its findings. Case studies demonstrate the use of CEAs in the areas of prevention, drug treatment, and new technologies. Students who take PM855 should not enroll in PM807.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-pm-940/"><strong>SPH PM 940: Health Policy and Management Culminating Experience</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: HPM concentrators in their final semester who have completed their Management or Policy &amp; Planning distribution requirement.</span><br>
                			Health Policy and Management concentrators must complete a culminating experience in their final semester of registration.  To document their work on the culminating experience, concentrators must register for SPH PM940, a zero-credit, pass/fail course.
