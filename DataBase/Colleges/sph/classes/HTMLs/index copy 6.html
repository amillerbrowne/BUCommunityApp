			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-lw-830/"><strong>SPH LW 830: Health Insurance, Health Reform and the Law</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: LW751 or JD867.</span><br>
                			The seminar examines the pivotal role of insurance in health reform, health policy and the distribution of health care in the US.  We explore how the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act affects the design, operation, and regulation of health benefit plans, as well as the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Investigating arguments for and against specific regulations, we learn fundamentals of insurance and whether reforms affect larger principles of law. We also study Massachusetts, the model for federal health reform, and the comparative advantages of federal and state governance. Students explore the changing roles of insurance in the health system by analyzing and comparing federal and state laws governing different health benefit plans (including indemnity insurance, managed care, consumer choice, and health promotion plans), and how reforms affect current law, including state licensure, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Topics include basic concepts of insurance; accepting, managing and shifting financial risk; individual and employer mandates; health insurance exchanges; contracting with providers, employers, and individuals; designing and administering plans; defining benefits; and appeals and remedies. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-lw-840/"><strong>SPH LW 840: Health Law, Bioethics, and Human Rights</strong></a><br>

Legal cases make up most of the course material. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-mc-705/"><strong>SPH MC 705: Safer Sex in the City: from Science to Policy</strong></a><br>
			            			Why do you need research-based knowledge about sex, sexuality, and how to apply this to public health? So you can understand and debate public health issues and controversies, such as STDs, contraception, and donor sperm and eggs. And maybe learn a little about yourself. This course will cover a range of topics related to sexuality and health application of this knowledge to program planning and policy.    		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-mc-725/"><strong>SPH MC 725: Women, Children and Adolescents: A Public Health Approach</strong></a><br>
			            			Women, Children and Adolescents: Public Health Approaches This course introduces students to the principles and practices of public health and maternal and child health.  Using the life-course perspective, this course examines the social determinants of  health and development of women, infants, children and adolescents. Selected current topics, such as asthma, adolescent pregnancy, infant mortality, and childhood obesity, are studied in depth and used to illustrate how problems are understood, their distribution in diverse populations, and the content and quality of programs required to address them. Throughout the course, special attention is given to the impact of poverty, poor access to health care, and racial inequities on the health of families, as well as to the strengths that individuals and communities bring to the creation of solutions. By the end of the course students will be able to formulate an MCH-related public health question, conduct and write a literature review, and write a policy memo. MC725 is the first required course in the MCH sequence. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">

			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: Epidemiology core course required; the biostatistics core course and MC725 recommended.</span><br>
                			Issues related to the perinatal period from the framework of epidemiologic methods will be examined in this course through critical review of epidemiologic studies and exploration of measurement, design and data issues for this population. The course will examine the effect of social conditions, perinatal exposures and programmatic strategies for maternal and infant health. Participants will review various sources of perinatal epidemiologic data, and will address classification issues and challenges in assessing pregnancy exposures and outcomes related to these data sources. The final course project will require a formal, written literature review as well as an NIH-style study proposal on a perinatal issue.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-mc-763/"><strong>SPH MC 763: Maternal and Child Health Policy Making</strong></a><br>
			            			This course explores the process by which U.S. national and state policymakers allocate resources to mothers and children.  Beginning with an analysis of the evolution of U.S. maternal and child health (MCH) policy, it utilizes general policy models and case studies to examine the special features of legislative, executive, administrative, and judicial policy making in MCH.  The course examines how policy making in MCH has traditionally been characterized by a greater reliance on regulatory and judicial bodies, as well as the frequent use of mothers and children as political symbols. This course is taught in seminar format with weekly readings and student-led discussion. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-mc-770/"><strong>SPH MC 770: Children with Special Health Care Needs</strong></a><br>
			            			The course presents an overview of issues related to the design and delivery of services for children with special health care needs and their families in the United States. It addresses the nature and extent of chronic illness and disability among children, the demographics of childhood disability, the legislative framework for health and social services for this population, and the organization and implementation of services at local, state and federal levels. Throughout the course, the central role of family in the child's life and the importance of family-centered service systems are emphasized. The challenge of balancing complex care needs with needs related to childhood social and cognitive development is highlighted. Students are given opportunities to enhance skills in the areas of needs assessment, program and policy development, and evaluation through class discussion, readings, and assignments.		</li><li class="dontsplit">

			            			This course is focused on strengthening public health students' knowledge, skills and ability to construct a critical appraisal of the determinants, distribution, causes, mechanisms, systems and consequences of health disparities. The course requirements, including the class presentations, help students in acquiring intermediate skills in design of public health interventions targeted toward understanding, reducing and ultimately eliminating health disparities among and across MCH populations.  Students will gain program evaluation skills through evaluation of allocation of resources and provision of health services in a specific community-based program. The course is designed to help students translate current knowledge and research into specific public health strategies. This class also carries concentration credit for the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences concentration.		</li></div><div class="last column" style="width: 48%; float: left;"><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-mc-782/"><strong>SPH MC 782: Women and Substance Use</strong></a><br>
			            			This course offers a window on the experiential context in which women -- including adolescent girls --develop substance abuse problems, and the health and social consequences for them and for their families. We will examine the complex, dynamic interaction of risk and resilience as it affects individuals, families, and communities, and learn about the interplay between substance abuse and co-existing mental health problems. The course will cover effective practices for screening and clinical assessment, gender-specific and family-centered treatment, prevention of relapse, and the importance of addressing co-morbidities as part of public health strategies. Throughout the course, we will consider special MCH populations, such as pregnant women. By the end of the course, students will demonstrate a deeper understanding of the complexity and inter-relatedness of personal and social environments in which substance abuse and mental health issues occur within families and strategies and policies for prevention, detection, and treatment. A research paper will be required.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-mc-785/"><strong>SPH MC 785: Introduction to Sexual and Reproductive Health Advocacy</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH LW 707 or equivalent (concurrent or completed) or consent of instructor</span><br>
                			This course prepares students to design, lead, or collaborate in advocacy efforts around reproductive health policy in the United States.  It allows students to focus on an array of issues related to women?s fertility and its regulation and to use multiple frameworks--public health science, law, social history, religion and politics--to frame and argue their positions for purposes of advocacy.  The course begins with an overview of the social and political history of fertility control and current reproductive health services and policies. We then examine debates at the state and national levels in preparation for advocacy skill-building and practice, including a visit to the State House, interaction with a panel of advocacy organizations, participation in mock legislative hearings, and the writing of an ?op ed? article for a local or national newspaper.  By the end of the course students demonstrate enhanced competence in critical analysis, argument, writing and presentation to audiences that range from public officials to the readers of popular press.  Interested students may append the course with directed study or practicum with Prof. McCloskey to complete a project at a reproductive health advocacy organization.		</li><li class="dontsplit">

			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-mc-815/"><strong>SPH MC 815: Sexual and Reproductive Health Advocacy: From Rights to Justice</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: MC725 for MCH concentrators or permission of instructor</span><br>
                			This course prepares students to design, lead, or collaborate in advocacy efforts around sexual and reproductive health policy in the United States, with attention to the global context in which the policies are developed and have their impact. Students focus on an array of issues related to sexual health and the regulation of women?s fertility, and use multiple frameworks--public health science, law, social history, religion and politics--to frame and argue their positions for purposes of advocacy. Students develop skills in critical analysis, argument, writing and presentation to audiences that range from public officials to the readers of popular press.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-mc-820/"><strong>SPH MC 820: Managing MCH Programs</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: SPH MC725</span><br>
                			This course helps students develop skills in program implementation and management.  The class moves through the implementation process step-by-step, culminating in the development of a complete programmatic management plan as the course final.  Class meetings build from the initial steps of problem definition through the development of a logic model, monitoring and evaluation planning, incorporation of appropriate strategies for engaging relevant stakeholders, design of program outreach materials, and development of a program budget.  Assignments are progressive: as new components are added to student plans, previous components are revised and refined.  The class emphasizes team work as well as development of individual skills.  Students learn to critique one another's work in workshop sessions scheduled at key junctures in the course.  Students are expected to have completed MC725 before taking MC820.  Exceptions are possible, however, for students from concentrations other than MCH and occasionally for students who can draw on substantial experience around a particular MCH topic. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-mc-840/"><strong>SPH MC 840: Women and Health Policy: Gender, Evidence, and Politics</strong></a><br>
