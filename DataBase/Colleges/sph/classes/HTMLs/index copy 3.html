			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sph/courses/sph-ih-707/"><strong>SPH IH 707: Kenya Field Practicum in Public Health and Environment</strong></a><br>
			                        <span>Graduate Prerequisites: The MPH epidemiology and biostatistics core courses or approved waivers.</span><br>
                			This 5-week course in Kenya focuses on environmental and community health as it relates to the indigenous Maasai residing at the base of Mount Kilimanjaro.  In the early 1980s Kenya began a process of privatizing open grazing land into group ranches. This significant land use change has forced traditionally nomadic peoples, including the Maasai, onto smaller plots of land.  This change in lifestyle has been associated with a rise in sanitation-related and water-borne diseases, infant and childhood disease and HIV/AIDS. Participants in the Kenya Field Practicum will be trained in field-based data collection, analysis, report-writing and presentation skills.  Past summer sessions have collected baseline information on water and sanitation practices, community health indicators and worked with local organizations to evaluate the success of health interventions.  Results and recommendations are presented to local Maasai leaders and other stakeholders.  Contact Joe Anzalone for information regarding application, travel, and related information.  The course also fulfills the BUSPH field practicum requirement if students also complete two skills-based professional development seminars.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
