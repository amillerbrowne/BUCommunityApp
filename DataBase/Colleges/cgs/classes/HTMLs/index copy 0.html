			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/cgs/courses/cgs-ds-103/"><strong>CGS DS 103: Directed Study</strong></a><br>
			            			In this two-credit course students work individually with a faculty member on a semester-long research project culminating in a substantial research paper (10-12 pages) that analyzes a public space in the Boston area, selected by the student.  Relevant scholarship in urban planning and design will be used as a lens to "read" how the chosen space functions as an urban environment, shaping the experience and behavior of those who use it or pass through it.  The research process is broken down into a series of grades assignments, and students meet regularly with their faculty member to discuss their progress. [Open only to students admitted to the CGS January Program]		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/cgs/courses/cgs-ds-104/"><strong>CGS DS 104: DIRECTED STUDY</strong></a><br>
			            			In this two-credit course, students work individually with a faculty member on a series of four writing assignments (selected from six options), each of which focuses on a different location in London, and each of which takes a different disciplinary perspective. Assignments typically combine visuals and texts, and are posted to the student's e-portfolio.  Students meet regularly with faculty to review their work-to-date and discuss their progress.

			            			This course will examine the outlaw as he appears in the literature, culture and history of Ireland.

			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/cgs/courses/cgs-ns-201/"><strong>CGS NS 201: Biology I</strong></a><br>
			            			Science as a way of knowing and understanding our contemporary world is the most profound and powerful intellectual and practical tool the human species has developed. Science has allowed humans to understand their physical place in the universe as well as their origin as a species on Earth. Science in our modern, global world can seem increasingly complex, while at the same time be reduced to a relatively few conceptual paradigms or accepted ideas. Many of these major paradigms will be covered in this course including modern cosmology, the origin or life, the molecular and cellular theories of life, human origins and genetics and evolutionary theory. The underlying pedagogy of the course is to examine what we know about an accepted paradigm, how we know these scientific facts and theories, and what are the contemporary applications of the accepted paradigms. The course also provides the primary scientific tools required to explore scientific, ethical and sociological concerns that arise from our understanding of the origin, evolution and diversity of life including that of our own species. Two hours lecture, Two hours lab.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/cgs/courses/cgs-ns-202/"><strong>CGS NS 202: Human Ecology/Global Ecology</strong></a><br>
			            			What is the fate of the biosphere and our species? Can humans reconcile economic and technological growth with ecological sustainability? This course examines the impact of one species, Homo sapiens, on the ecosystems of the biosphere, seeking answers to these broad questions. This includes an investigation of the physical forces that shape global climates and ultimately constrain life on Earth. An examination of the interrelationships between the abiotic and biotic components in ecosystems leads to an investigation of the forces that influence biological diversity. The integrative study of population biology culminates in an investigation of the population dynamics of our own species and the implications the exponential growth of the human population may have on global resources and the biosphere. The foundation in general ecology and human population dynamics allows a serious consideration of the technological impact of humans on the delicately balanced ecosystems of Earth. The interrelationship between science and society is also explored. Two hours lecture, Two hours lab.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/cgs/courses/cgs-rh-101/"><strong>CGS RH 101: English Composition: Argument and Critical Thinking</strong></a><br>
			            			Begins with critical reading, writing, and thinking strategies.  Students learn the conventions of the expository essay and how to meet its demands by developing a thesis, organizing an argument, and supporting claims with reasoning and evidence.  Students also receive instruction in grammar, style, and document design.  Through class discussion and by working on assignments, students explore connections between readings assigned in Rhetoric and their readings in other courses.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/cgs/courses/cgs-rh-102/"><strong>CGS RH 102: English Composition and Research</strong></a><br>

			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/cgs/courses/cgs-rh-103/"><strong>CGS RH 103: Rhetoric I: Changing Times, Changing Minds: Revolutions in the Ancient World through the Enlightenment</strong></a><br>
			            			This course offers instruction in writing, critical reading and research.  It focuses on four themes taken from the four units that comprise the semester's curriculum ("The Birth of 'God': The Advent of Monotheism"; "The Development of Democracy and the Democratic Self"; "Rediscovering Nature and the Self: The Renaissance"; and "Reason to Revolution: The Enlightenment"). Readings and discussions relate these themes to current issues and problems in order to explore how the past has shaped the world of today.  Three papers invite students to research and write about these relationships. Shorter informal writing assignments allow students to integrate the texts and lectures across the curriculum with learning experiences outside the classroom. The course makes extensive use of the university library and online resources to teach research skills. Finally, students learn core academic writing skills, including argumentation and the evaluation, integration, and documentation of sources. [Open only to students admitted to the CGS January Program]		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/cgs/courses/cgs-rh-104/"><strong>CGS RH 104: Rhetoric II: Changing Times, Changing Minds: The Industrial Revolution through the Digital Revolution</strong></a><br>

The course further develops skills in expository writing and introduces exploratory essay writing. Students continue to explore the contemporary relevance and meaning of the interdisciplinary curriculum. Students refine their skills in grammar, style, organization, and document design.
