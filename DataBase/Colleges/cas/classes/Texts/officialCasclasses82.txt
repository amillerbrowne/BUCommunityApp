CAS RN 100: Introduction to Religion
	Religion matters. It makes meaning and provides structure to life, addressing fundamental questions  about body, spirit, community, and time. But what is it? How does it work in our world? This course  explores religion in ritual, philosophical, experiential, and ethical dimensions. Carries humanities divisional credit in CAS. 		

CAS RN 101: The Bible
	Introductory study of Jewish and Christian scriptures; connections between biblical and related ancient  cultures; biblical genres (epic narrative, law, prophecy, poetry, historiography, gospels, letters, apocalypse)  and their literary character, major classical and modern strategies of reading. Carries humanities divisional credit in CAS. 		

CAS RN 102: Sacred Journeys
	An introduction to the comparative study of religion through the theme of the sacred journey/religious  quest in Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, and popular literature. Topics include heroic, romantic, and/or  mystical quests; voyages to the underworld; apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic journeys. Carries humanities divisional credit in CAS. 		

CAS RN 103: Religions of the World: Eastern
	Study of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Shinto. Focus on the world view of each tradition and the historical development of that world view. Carries humanities divisional credit in CAS. 		

CAS RN 104: Religions of the World: Western
	Islam, Christianity, and Judaism in historical and cultural context, origins to the present. Examines diversity  of practices, belief systems, and social structures within these religions. Also addresses debates within and  between communities as well as contemporary concerns.Carries humanities divisional credit in CAS.		

CAS RN 106: Death and Immortality
	Examines death as religious traditions have attempted to accept, defeat, deny, or transcend it. Do we have souls? Do they reincarnate? Other topics include cremation, ancestor worship, apocalypse, alchemy, AIDS, near-death experiences, otherworld cosmologies. 		

CAS RN 111: Multireligious America
	Introduction to American religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism, with an emphasis on developments after 1965, when new legislation opened up immigration and dramatically altered the American religious landscape.  Exploration of interreligious interactions: conflict, cooperation, and creolization. 		

CAS RN 121: Religion in America
	Religion in American history from early European encounters with indigenous peoples to the pluralistic  present.
