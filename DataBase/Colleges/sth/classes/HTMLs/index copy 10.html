			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-ts-840/"><strong>STH TS 840: Seminar in Religion and Social Change</strong></a><br>
			            			An exploration of the relationship between religion and social change, including the problems of modernization and globalization.

			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-ts-845/"><strong>STH TS 845: Christian Social Ethics</strong></a><br>
			            			Comparative study of historical and contemporary Christian approaches to the nature, sources, methods,  and concepts of ethics in diverse contexts.

			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-ts-854/"><strong>STH TS 854: The Boston University Ethical Tradition</strong></a><br>
			            			This seminar is designed to orient participants to the BU tradition in theology   and ethics that has its roots in the 19th century. We will consider the Boston   Personalists beginning with Borden Parker Bowne, John Wesley Edward Bowen, and   especially the work of Edgar S. Brightman, as well as the later Personalists --  Albert C. Knudson and Francis McConnell. We will also explore the works of   Georgia Harkness, L. Harold DeWolf, Peter Bertocci, and in particular, Walter   Muelder (and the Moral Law tradition). There is an emphasis on Howard Thurman   and his impact on BU, as well as the influence of the BU ethical tradition on   the life and work of Martin Luther King, Jr. We will also consider the ethics of   contemporary exponents of the BU ethical tradition. Throughout the seminar,   there is consideration given to the philosophical and theological roots of the   BU ethical tradition as well as its social, economic, and political   applications. This tradition is based on the belief in a personal God who cares   about people, and made each person in the divine image-endowed with inherent   value, worth and dignity. This is a central message of the BU ethical tradition,   and in the seminar, we will look at is foundations as well as its evolution, and   also why that tradition historically was attractive to Black graduate students   in theology and social ethics.		</li><li class="dontsplit">

			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-ts-893/"><strong>STH TS 893: Spirit, Science, and Space: Cosmoethics</strong></a><br>
			            			The discoveries of Copernicus/Galileo and Darwin (19th century) significantly altered scientific and    religious worldviews. People experienced a sense of displacement from their previously perceived status  in   the universe. In the 21st century, as space explorations expand, Contact with extraterrestrial life--    including intelligent life--becomes ever more possible (some people already claim to have had visual or    physical contact with UFOs and their alien occupants). Using perspectives from science, science fiction,    religion, and United Nations space treaties, and narratives about peoples' claims of encounters with    extraterrestrial beings, this course will discuss current and projected understandings of the human  place   in the cosmos; reflect on how discovery of extraterrestrial life might impact the human sense of  place in   the universe; and consider how the impacts of ET encounters (actual or theoretical) might be  positively   incorporated into human consciousness and contexts.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
