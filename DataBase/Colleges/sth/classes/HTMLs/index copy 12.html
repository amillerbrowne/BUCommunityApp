			            			This course examines the impact of philosophers like Nietzsche, Foucault, Levinas, Irigaray, and Derrida on  the study of theology. Rather than shutting down a religious conversation, theologians within this tradition  argue that postmodern thought opens up religious questions in new ways. What does postmodernism  reveal about religious confessions and practices? How does this conversation help us to understand some  of the shifts in spirituality and religious practice in our contemporary world? (John Caputo, Mark C. Taylor,  Catherine Keller, and Mark D. Jordan). (Requires TF 701/702 or equivalent)		</li><li class="dontsplit">

The seminar will read a variety of  works    in contemporary religious naturalism, from twentieth-century classics to current contributions,  and from    theoretical analyses of the meaning of naturalism to surveys attempting to map out the  territory of    plausible viewpoints. We will also track the close relationship between religious naturalism  and both    ecologically-rooted forms of spirituality and nature-centered forms of mysticism. (Requires TF 701/702 or  equivalent)		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-862/"><strong>STH TT 862: Theologies of Liberation</strong></a><br>

			            			Feminist and womanist theologians provide some of the sharpest theological  analyses of the ways in which  power functions both within and outside of  religious institutions. This course explores these contributions  to an  understanding of power, both divine and human, and the ways in which practices  and professions of  religious traditions can be both death-dealing and life- giving. How does power operate on bodies, in  institutions, in global markets?  What is the fuel "the power" necessary for social change and  transformation?  Examining critical moments in 20th century movements of liberation, this course  draws  on theory, theology, literature, and media to give theological depth and  understanding to religious claims  about love, power, and justice.
