			            			This course introduces contemporary science to students with research and writing interests in the area  of   science, philosophy, and religion. It also treats scientific boundary questions, which are philosophical,    ethical, and theological questions raised by science yet not answerable within science itself. This is more    than a popular science course; it is the course to take when you are ready to go beyond popular science,    and you are ready for integrative thinking that connects science, philosophy, history, ethics, and  theology.   The Fall semester lectures are on the biological sciences. That semester can be taken  independently of the   Spring semester on physics. The mathematics required for the Spring lectures on  physics is taught   through the whole year in a separate meeting. You should consult the instructor about  your background   and readiness to take this course prior to registering.		</li><li class="dontsplit">

			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-874/"><strong>STH TT 874: Contemporary Theological Systems</strong></a><br>
			            			An exploration of contemporary systematic perspectives on the Christian faith aimed at facilitating the  development of the student's own ability to think theologically and to construct his or her own theological  perspective in light of his or her own theological tradition and the contemporary situation. (Requires TF  701/702 or equivalent)		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-889/"><strong>STH TT 889: Theologies of Sexual Identity</strong></a><br>
			            			A study of the conceptual, biblical, historical, scientific, and critical roots of the current issues about sexual  identity, focusing on women's ordination and gay marriage as prisms to understand the feminist and gay  cultural revolutions.  These movements have called attention to sexual identities more generally, and the  theology of sexually identity for all human beings will be developed. (Requires TF 701/702 or equivalent)		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-890/"><strong>STH TT 890: Topics in Speculative Philosophy: The Axiology of Thinking</strong></a><br>
			            			A detailed study of the thesis that valuation structures thinking in imagination, interpretation, theorizing,  and the pursuit of responsibility. Principal texts are the instructor's Reconstruction of Thinking, Recovery of  the Measure, and Normative Cultures. (Requires TF 701/702 or equivalent)		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-895/"><strong>STH TT 895: Rise of Neo-Confucianism</strong></a><br>
			            			This course is an analysis of the rise of Neo-Confucianism in the Song Dynasty and its continued    development in the Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties in China as well as its transmission to Korea, Japan and    Vietnam. The synthesis of Zhu Xi's daoxue 道學 [Chu Hsi] (1130-1200) will serve as a major    case study of the development and influence of Neo-Confucian philosophy. The course will also pursue the    modern developments of New Confucianism in East Asia and the West with the examples of New    Confucianism and Boston Confucianism. One of the interesting features in the modern period has been the    revival of Confucian-Christian dialogue. (Requires TF 701/702 or equivalent)		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-898/"><strong>STH TT 898: Theology and Trauma</strong></a><br>
			            			This course aims to bring the recent studies in the interdisciplinary study of  trauma to bear on the field of  theology. What unique challenges does the  phenomenon of trauma pose to contemporary theology?  The  first part of the  course explores recent studies in trauma, focusing on three areas of research:  1)  neurobiology of trauma, 2) clinical/therapeutic studies, and 3) literary  approaches to trauma.   The second  part of the course examines theological  engagements with issues of radical suffering.  The third part  brings together  the insights from the first two and focuses on the question of what it means to  witness  theologically to individual, societal, and global trauma. We will look  at issues and contexts such as the  criminal justice system, war, poverty, and  racism. In this final part, students will be working towards  constructive  theological engagements with issues of trauma through interaction with a variety  of  mediums: art, literature, spiritual practices, and film.    The course is not  a counseling course. It aims to  provide rich theological reflection around  issues of suffering, violence, and trauma, both individual and  global. (Requires TF 701/702 or equivalent)		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-899/"><strong>STH TT 899: Schleiermacher</strong></a><br>
			            			The primary aim of this course is read and understand the theology of Friedrich  Daniel Ernst   Schleiermacher, one  of the most important and influential European  intellectuals of the 19th century, and   known variously as the Father  of  Romanticism, the Father of Hermeneutics, the Father of German Plato   studies, the  Father of Modern Protestant  Theology, and the Father of Liberal Christian  Theology. The   course focuses on The Christian Faith (CF) but also  covers some  other of his writings particularly On   Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured  Despisers (OR) and Letters  to LÃ¼cke (LL) and some biographical   material. The  secondary aim is to help students develop their own  theological ideas in  detailed   conversation with Schleiermacher's, a purpose for which CF is  particularly well  suited. (Requires TF  701/702 or equivalent)		</li></div><div class="last column" style="width: 48%; float: left;"><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-900/"><strong>STH TT 900: The Theological Imagination</strong></a><br>
			            			Within the arena of constructive theology, theologians are increasingly describing their theological projects  in terms of analyzing and reshaping "imaginaries." The course traces the emergence of this 'turn to the  imaginary' within modernity and postmodernity and examines what's at stake theologically in this turn.  This seminar involves: 1) exploring the concept of 'the imaginary,' identifying philosophical, sociological  and literary influences; 2) articulating what's at stake for theology; and 3) constructing theological visions  that can expand the study and practices of Christian traditions. The first part situates the rise of the  concept of the imaginary within the context of modern theology. Here, we will examine the varying reasons  for theological appeals to the imagination, asking what's at stake for each and will examine the portrait  that each presents of theology's relationship to modernity. We will be engaging questions of the nature and  task of theology, theological method, immanence/transcendence, and religious language. The second part  will focus on critiques of the western (Christian) imaginary. In this part, we take a decidedly postmodern  turn and explore the appeals to the imaginary from various thinkers who are trying to reshape the  imaginary otherwise. The third part will focus on the form of theology and explore the implications of our  study for the re-forming of theological discourse.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-901/"><strong>STH TT 901: Core Texts and Motifs: Western Traditions</strong></a><br>
			            			An intensive year seminar, in English translation, of key primary texts and  philosophical-theological-religious ideas of Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism,  and Taoism. Particularly well suited to doctoral students. Advanced master's  students with permission of instructor only.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-902/"><strong>STH TT 902: Core Texts and Motifs of World Religions: East</strong></a><br>
			            			Prereq:(CASCC101 &amp; CASCC102) or two courses in religion or philosophy. *An intensive seminar in primary  texts and key ideas of theology and religious philosophy as developed in representative world religions:  Hinduism, Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism. Second course in a year-long sequence. Each semester may  be taken independently.  		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-913/"><strong>STH TT 913: Science and Religion</strong></a><br>
			            			Quantum entanglement is one of the most remarkable ideas to have emerged from physics in the twentieth    century. Identified as a consequence of quantum theory already in the 1920s, it was not confirmed as a    physical phenomenon until the 1980s. The broader implications of living in an "entangled" world are only    beginning to be felt outside the walls of physics. This course explores the significance of quantum    entanglement for theological reflection on creaturely and divine relationality.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-921/"><strong>STH TT 921: Proseminar: Religion and Science</strong></a><br>
			            			This doctoral level seminar provides an advanced introduction to the core literature and issues of the interdisciplinary field of religion and science. The primary texts are Ian Barbour's Religion and Science: Historical and Contemporary Issues, John Hedley Brooke's Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives, the edited collection titled Religion and Science: History, Method, Dialogue (Mark Richardson and Wesley Wildman, eds.), and the Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science (Philip Clayton, ed.). The four primary areas considering during the semester are: historical relations, comparative method, disciplinary perspectives, and theoretical debates. The course is a requirement for BU PhD students in the science and religion track of Division of Religious and Theological Studies. Advanced masters students may enroll with the instructor's permission.  		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-923/"><strong>STH TT 923: Philosophical Cosmology</strong></a><br>
			            			The purpose of this course is to introduce students to major positions in  philosophical cosmology relative to the twin questions of the nature of God and  scientific knowledge of the natural world.  Connected with both of these is the  question of where value lies in the world, if anywhere, given the assumptions of  a fact-value distinction in modern science. The main interest will be with  discussions in the West, although some comparative points will be made. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-924/"><strong>STH TT 924: Theological Aesthetics</strong></a><br>
			            			Why is the retrieval of beauty essential in an age of terror? Grace Jantzen suggests that a displacement of beauty in western consciousness can be directly correlated with the increase of violence in post/modernity. Following JantzenÂs call for a theology of beauty, we will explore the significance of aesthetics in the current religious landscape. Using Hans Urs von BalthasarÂs theological aesthetics as a lens for exploring the relationship between beauty and the divine, we will examine key works in western thought in which beauty plays a significant role (Plato, Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius, John Damascene, Bonaventure, Kierkegaard). In the second half of the course, we will survey recent discussions of aesthetics in continental philosophy, literature, and ethics as they intersect with the study of religion (using Continental Aesthetics Reader). In these latter sessions, we will focus on specialized topics: sacred space, sacred dance, sacred bodies and advertising, and sacred writing in order to see how the theory engaged in the first part of the course informs contemporary issues. What impact does this theological retrieval have on contemporary discussions of justice, trauma, conflict, and terror? What role could theological aesthetics play in a heavily visual culture? Although we will trace beauty predominantly through Christian thought, students are encouraged to pursue projects in which they explore the aesthetic dimensions of other religions. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-925/"><strong>STH TT 925: Special topics: Contemporary Pragmatism</strong></a><br>

			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-928/"><strong>STH TT 928: Theology Proseminar</strong></a><br>
			            			The purpose of this seminar is professional formation of doctoral students in Boston University through the study of certain central approaches to theology and an introduction to program requirements, faculty and library resources, reading lists, and qualifying examinations.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sth/courses/sth-tt-929/"><strong>STH TT 929: Proseminar in Comparative Theology</strong></a><br>
			            			A study of the development of the new theological sub-discipline known as Comparative Theology (comparative here means the comparison and contrast between and among different traditions representing diverse cultural regions, both diachronic and synchronic in form and function). There will be a series of introductory remarks by the instructor (ca. two weeks). For the balance of the course, students will make class presentations based on various readings and more specialized research projects. The goal of the course will be to provide an overview of the field as well as the articulation of individual approaches and methods for constructing comparative theologies.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
