We will examine the nature of religious experience and the difficulties in translating this experience into language.

STH TC 937: Vocation, Work, and Faith
	Who am I called to become? What am I called to do? What are my gifts and where will they be recognized  and of service? These kinds of vocational questions are fundamental to our lives. The course seeks to open  up reflection, study, and dialogue about vocation, work, and spirituality in religious traditions and in our  own life experience. Work and vocation are often connected. Work too is a crucial religious question in  contemporary society. Work exerts a powerful--and often unrecognized--influence on human beings. It  can support life, develop talents, elicit creativity, and enable people to contribute to the common good.  Work also can demean human beings, undermining their dignity, perpetuating unjust structures,  overpowering values, and crowding out other important spheres of life. Labor issues are important  concerns for faith communities and faith-based community organizations. This course explores vocation  and work as theological/spiritual issues, including implications for ministry. We will explore themes such  as: work as spiritual practice or challenge; labor and justice issues; discerning vocation; creativity; Sabbath;  "time poverty"; and work-life balance. The course involves site visits, vocational mentoring, seminar  presentations, and individual research/ministry projects.

	ÃÂ&nbsp; This course explores a religious pedagogy that enables communities of faith to integrate the personal formation of their members with their communal public actions for social transformation.

Rather than separate tasks, participants are invited to understand these as one integrated task. The pedagogy of practicing theology will be introduced to show how it enables people in communities of faith to develop their personhoods, as they participate in the communities' actions for social transformation.
