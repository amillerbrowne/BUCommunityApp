			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sar/courses/sar-pt-550/"><strong>SAR PT 550: Scientific Basis of Human Movement</strong></a><br>
			            <span>Undergraduate Prerequisites: SAR PT 520.</span><br>
                            			This course provides an overview of current theory and data that address the question of how humans select, perform, and learn skilled actions. Students will learn to apply basic principles of sensorimotor coordination and control to physical therapy evaluation and intervention planning, and learn how these principles can be used to guide treatment of dysfunctional movements, regardless of the type of underlying disease/injury, impairment, activity limitation or participation restriction. Emphasis will be placed on: (1) understanding how movements emerge from the interaction of individual, task, and environmental constraints; and (2) understanding the resources that the individual brings to any given skilled action (biomechanical, neuromuscular, sensory, cognitive and cardiopulmonary systems). The basic systems approach proposed by Bernstein for an adequate motor control theory will be used as a way to critique theories currently used as a basis for physical therapy, and to introduce the concepts of system constraints and of dynamical systems theory. The ways in which the constraints/dynamics approach can be integrated with the disablement model adopted by the APTA in its clinical practice guidelines (the World Health Organization's ICF model) will be identified. The results will allow the student to gain insight into how to conceptualize a holistic model of the factors that influence the patient's behavior, identify causes of problems, and learn a thought process for evaluation and treatment.		</li><li class="dontsplit">

			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/sar/courses/sar-pt-653/"><strong>SAR PT 653: Neurological System II</strong></a><br>
			            <span>Undergraduate Prerequisites: SARPT652</span><br>
                            			This course is a continuation of Examination and Treatment of Neurological Systems I and emphasizes evidence based physical therapy management for people who have specific neurological disorders. In PT652, a general foundation was developed for examining, evaluating, and determining appropriate interventions for individuals who have movement dysfunction secondary to neurological deficits. PT 653 will build on the foundation developed in PT 652 by considering how specific neurological disorders guide physical therapy practice. The course will focus on pathophysiology, examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, plan of care, intervention, and expected outcomes for commonly encountered diagnoses in neurorehabilitation such as Multiple Sclerosis, Traumatic Brain Injury, Spinal Cord Injury, Parkinson's Disease, and Cerebral Palsy. Common diagnostic groups are chosen with the intent of enhancing specific knowledge as well as developing a general problem solving approach that applies to any type of neurological diagnosis. The included diagnoses will illustrate how decision-making in physical therapy takes into account issues of age (life span), natural history, stage in the disease process, and nature (stable vs. progressive) of specific neurological disorders. Students will learn to develop a plan for examination, including the most sensitive and specific standardized examination tools, and to develop a plan of care that is specific to various diagnostic groups and that is based on current evidence.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
