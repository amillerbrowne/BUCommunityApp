			            			Art education student teachers witness faculty and guests who address their areas of expertise, and engage a learning community comprised of peers and professionals in meaningful, substantive dialogue.  Students demonstrate the value of engaging in constructive conversations with people of differing opinions; show the commitment of BU, the College of Fine Arts, the School of Visual Arts, and the Department of Art Teacher and Museum Education to the life of the mind of those in the art community; and invite the larger community to see the results of studio teaching and learning.

			            			From the kinesthetic experiences of rhythmic movement experienced by very young children to the development of individual symbol systems to develop a personal artistic language, this course provides an introduction to the methodology of teaching art to children in grades pre K-8.  It aims to help students develop a personal philosophy of teaching and to translate evidence and theory into strategies that support children's learning in the visual arts.  Topics of study include the artistic development of children in relation to cognitive, emotional, linguistic, and social growth; approaches to studio pedagogy and general communication skills; and lesson planning that addresses voluntary and mandated national, state, and local district curriculum standards.  Drawing in the Galleries is a pre-practicum Saturday program offered one or two times during the fall by the Department of Art Teacher and Museum Education. Students who are taking this course engage K-8 grade level learners from Boston metropolitan area elementary schools in producing art work that is thematically aligned with current exhibitions in University galleries.  		</li><li class="dontsplit">

			            			This first in the sequence of music education "methods" courses examines the personal attributes and professional skills of music teachers whose work with children is categorized as "artful." Through readings, films, discussions, reflections, and sustained teaching experiences with young children in an urban school, students will be introduced to the many roles that music educators play while simultaneously reflecting on personal motivations for becoming a music teacher. This course emphasizes acquisition of instructional "moves" and strategies as it engages students in becoming astute, analytical, and empathic observers of teachers and students in classroom settings. Issues of poverty and social class as they relate to music teaching and learning are examined.  Weekly filed work experiences (sustained internship) help the student to gain confidence in dealing with children in urban elementary school settings. Weekly singing in class on campus will help students become more confident vocalists as they build a repertoire of songs for use in schools.  All students will begin construction of an e-portfolio, regularly and independently, adding artifacts produced in this course, in their internships, and through their musical studies. The e-portfolio will be presented for music education faculty and peer review in the latter part of the second semester of this course.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
