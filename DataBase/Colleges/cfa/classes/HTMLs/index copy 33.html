In‐depth analysis of the current medium as it exists in all markets (film, television, and online) will be a constant element of the course. 2.0 credits. Fall semester. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">

Various scenarios for meetings/auditions/screen tests will help to make students "industry-ready" and serve as a precursor to the post graduate "Acting in Hollywood" program 2.0 credits. Fall semester.   Spring Semester: In the second semester College of Fine Arts and College of Communication students work in collaboration to rehearse, develop and film material for presentation. The course emphasizes building stronger communication in the actor and director relationship especially as it relates to the artistic on camera storytelling process. The course meets weekly for both in class exercises, development of camera technique, as well as filmed scene presentation and critique. However, students should be prepared to commit additional hours outside of class for rehearsal and at times the filming of their scenes. 2.0 credits. Spring semester.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
