This course will deal with the real world issues and problem-solving for brand identities. Students will develop logos as a point of entry to a brand for a series of assigned hypothetical companies. A creative marketing oriented brief will precede each assignment. Each project will include: applications for stationery; web-site home page look-and-feel; product nomenclature or packaging; and signage (where applicable). Logos include symbols, wordmarks, single letters such as H for Herman Miller, pictorial marks like the Michelin Man and abstract symbols like Chase Manhattan. The creative brief will contain information about the target audience for each assignment. Students must have a good practical knowledge of typography, as it is the key ingredient for this course.  "A good logo should suggest, not explain."    Paul Rand 		</li></div><br style="clear: both;"></ul>
