			            			This final studio aims to help the students' natural artistic abilities reach their fullest potential by stressing professional habits and standards of workmanship. The goal of this course is to help students make significant strides toward being working sculptors outside the academic environment. Sculpture is one of the visual languages of plastic forms; in this class, we use the human figure as a vehicle to better understand the fundamentals of organic forms, proportion, and balance. Students will use this experience to communicate their own ideas through a series of individual compositions working towards their final thesis exhibition, and later create a portfolio of their works.   		</li><li class="dontsplit">

			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/cfa/courses/cfa-ar-361/"><strong>CFA AR 361: Elementary Methods of Art Education (4 credits; fall semester)</strong></a><br>
			            			From the kinesthetic experiences of rhythmic movement experienced by very young children to the development of individual symbol systems to develop a personal artistic language, this course provides an introduction to the methodology of teaching art to children in grades pre K-8.  It aims to help students develop a personal philosophy of teaching and to translate evidence and theory into strategies that support children's learning in the visual arts.  Topics of study include the artistic development of children in relation to cognitive, emotional, linguistic, and social growth; approaches to studio pedagogy and general communication skills; and lesson planning that addresses voluntary and mandated national, state, and local district curriculum standards.  Drawing in the Galleries is a pre-practicum Saturday program offered one or two times during the fall by the Department of Art Teacher and Museum Education. Students who are taking this course engage K-8 grade level learners from Boston metropolitan area elementary schools in producing art work that is thematically aligned with current exhibitions in University galleries.  		</li><li class="dontsplit">

			            			This course is designed to acquaint the learner with the role of an art educator in the secondary setting.  Art content and concepts are used to teach the ways in which the design of studio learning experiences can enhance students' artistic, creative, and aesthetic development.  The cognitive, socio-cultural, and physical characteristics of pre-adolescent and adolescent learners that impact sound instructional methodology and planning as perceived by the school, the student(s), and the teacher are considered. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">

			            			This elementary practicum offers an opportunity for art education majors to student teach grade levels Pre-K-9.  The student collaborates with the Head of the Art Teacher and Museum Education program to identify a certified visual arts cooperating teacher in a Boston metropolitan area school where student teaching can be completed during eight consecutive weeks.

The third and final observation also includes an evaluation with comments from all three participants in the process:  the student, the cooperating teacher, and the supervising teacher.  Paperwork is generated that is be filed by the University and sent forward to the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education that documents the fulfillment of requirements that may lead to teacher certification.    The first two weeks of the practicum consist of aiding and observing the cooperating teacher and other teachers in the school.  During the second two weeks of the practicum, the student assumes one-third of the cooperating teacher's full responsibilities.  The third two weeks of the practicum the student teacher assumes two-thirds of the cooperating teacher's full responsibilities.  The student teacher assumes all responsibilities assigned to the cooperating teacher during the final two weeks of the practicum.    300 hours of attendance are required; 150/300 hours the student teacher must be fully responsible for studio teaching. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">
