Repertoire includes everything from rock and blues classics to jazz standards.  Section C, Advanced Guitar, is for more experienced guitar students. This section focuses on improving one's playing through mastery of chord and scale fingerings, understanding the music theory behind them, and putting all that information and physical skill to work in the context of improvising and accompanying a selection of jazz standards.
