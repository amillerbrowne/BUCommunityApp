Based on  each question, students will use primary and secondary historic sources to 'solve' that  historical  question. Once the question is "solved," the remainder of the class will be devoted to  exploring multiple  ways and instances in which to teach that question, skill, and/or concept. Students  will then practice  teaching these skills and concepts to each other or other volunteers drawn from the  historic site.
