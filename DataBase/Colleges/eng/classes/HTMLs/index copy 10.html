			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/eng/courses/eng-ek-731/"><strong>ENG EK 731: Bench-to-Bedside: Translating Biomedical Innovation from the Laboratory to the  Marketplace</strong></a><br>
			            			The subject of the course is the translation of medical technologies into new  products and services for the healthcare system. The course begins with a  rigorous study of intellectual property, licensing and the core aspects of  planning, creating, funding and building new entrepreneurial ventures. Concepts  and tools are presented for assessing new technologies and their potential to be  the basis for a new entrepreneurial venture. Comparisons will be made of how  technologies can be sourced and commercialized out of three very different  environments: universities, national laboratories and corporate laboratories.  Cross-disciplinary teams of students will be formed which will evaluate  translational research projects currently being developed at Boston University  and their potential for transformation into a start-up company to commercialize  the technology, providing a unique linkage between the scientific research  activities of the university and the professional schools. Each week there will  be a case study which will discuss examples of both success and failure in  technology commercialization. Some of these case studies examine Boston  University life sciences spin-out companies, and the founders and CEO?s of these  ventures will share their experiences with the class.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
