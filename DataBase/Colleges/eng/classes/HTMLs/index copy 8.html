			            			This course surveys the applications of optical science and engineering to a variety of biomedical problems, with emphasis on optical and photonics technologies that enable real, minimally-invasive clinical applications. The course teaches only those aspects of biology itself that are necessary to understand the purpose of the application. The first weeks introduce the optical properties of tissue, and following lectures cover a range of topics in three general areas: 1) Optical spectroscopy applied to diagnosis of cancer and other tissue diseases; 2) Photon migration and optical imaging of subsurface structures in tissue; and 3) Laser-tissue interactions and other applications of light for therapeutic purposes. In addition to formal lectures, recent publications from the literature will be selected as illustrative of various topical areas, and for each publication one student will be assigned to prepare an informal presentation (with overhead slides or PowerPoint) reviewing for the class the underlying principles of that paper and outlining the research results. Same as ENGBE765; students may not receive credit for both. 		</li><li class="dontsplit">

			            <span>Undergraduate Prerequisites: ENG EC 571; consent of instructor</span><br>
                            			EC772 is a project-oriented course that demonstrates the use of high-level   design techniques.  There are lectures, milestone presentations, and a final   presentation.  The lectures, interleaved with tutorials showing the utilization   of Verilog, the Cadence RTL compiler, and Silicon Encounter, define the general   design flow.  Additional design issues are also elaborated in the form of   classroom lectures, which take up a fraction of the course class time. Student   groups of 2-5 define their own projects, which are scrutinized by the entire   class as to difficulty and possibility of success.   Milestones entail both oral   (presented in class times) and written components.  Typically, by the time of   the final presentation, the milestone documents can be simply, with test results   (not necessarily simple), are combined to demonstrate the veracity of the final   chip design.  Pay special attention to prerequisites.   Verilog is at the heart   of almost everything.  EC311 and EC413 or equivalent courses can provide the   minimal Verilog proficiency for LEAP students.  These courses do not qualify for   grad student credit, so EC551 (Verilog: may be co-req) or equivalent Verilog  skill is  necessary.   EC571 VLSI Design or strong equivalent proficiency in  digital  circuits at the transistor level is also essential.  		</li><li class="dontsplit">

                			This course will present a rigorous and detailed overview of the theory of optical microscopy starting from basic notions in light propagation and covering advanced concepts in imaging theory such as Fourier optics and partial coherence.

Biological applications such as calcium and membrane-potential imaging will be discussed. A background in optics is preferable. A background in signals and analysis is indispensable. In particular, the student should be comfortable with Fourier transforms, complex analysis, and transfer functions. Meets with ENGBE773.  Students may not receive credit for both.		</li></div><br style="clear: both;"></ul>
