Comparisons will be made of how  technologies can be sourced and commercialized out of three very different  environments: universities, national laboratories and corporate laboratories.  Cross-disciplinary teams of students will be formed which will evaluate  translational research projects currently being developed at Boston University  and their potential for transformation into a start-up company to commercialize  the technology, providing a unique linkage between the scientific research  activities of the university and the professional schools. Each week there will  be a case study which will discuss examples of both success and failure in  technology commercialization. Some of these case studies examine Boston  University life sciences spin-out companies, and the founders and CEO?s of these  ventures will share their experiences with the class.
