LAW BK 903: Financial Services Law Internship
	This course seeks to give students real world experience in the practice of  financial services law by immersing them in the day-to-day operations of a law  firm, financial services organization or regulatory agency. Students are  expected to work under the supervision of a lawyer and a faculty advisor who  will ensure that the students have a meaningful, relevant and rigorous  experience. It is expected that the Internship will involve a minimum of ten  hours workplace experience per week. The Graduate Progam will exercise its best  efforts to arrange internships at local law firms, financial services firms, or  governmental bodies. Participation is subject to availability of positions and a  matching of student interests with the organizationsÂ¡Â¦ needs.   Awarding of  credits will be on a pass-fail basis and will not be included in the student's  cumulative GPA. Credit will be based on reports submitted by the student. The  internship is open only to full-time students who are enrolled in at least 6  other credit subjects during the semester in which the internship occurs. Unless  waived by the Director, this course is open only to students who are studying  for the concentration in Financial Services Transactions, for which it is a  requirement.		

LAW BK 912: Introduction to the American Legal System
	This course focuses principally on three areas: (1) the use of case law as a  primary source of American law, including analysis of cases, reasoning from  prior cases, the evolution of case law, and the case method of teaching; (2) the  structure of the American legal system and selected elements of Constitutional  law, such as allocation of powers among the three branches of government, the  relationship between federal and state courts, due process of law, equal  protection, and other key concepts; and (3) a brief introduction to particular  private law subjects such as contracts, intellectual property, criminal  procedure and torts. The goal is to provide insight into the methods used by  American lawyers in dealing with legal questions and an introduction to the  structural and substantive legal framework within which American lawyers  operate. This course is no longer a required course for students who did not  obtain their first law degree at a law school in the United States.

LAW BK 987: Securitization
	Securitization and structured finance together constitute one of the most  dynamic segments of the financial markets. Securitization involves the creation  and issuance of securities backed by one or more assets which generate cash  flows sufficient to fund the securities. Structured finance includes  securitization as well as transactions in which securities are not issued, but  which involve the often complex structuring of cash flows to achieve a desired  tax, accounting or financial objective. These transactions often cut across many  areas of legal specialization, including bank and thrift regulation, securities  regulation, taxation, bankruptcy and insolvency, fiduciary law, real estate law  and environmental law. This course examines a series of actual transactions to  explore the sometimes contradictory ways that these various legal constructs  impinge upon the structuring transactions. Examples include single-family  mortgage pools, trade receivable securitizations and commercial mortgage  securitizations. This course also explores some of the more cutting-edge  securitizations of exotic asset classes such as legal fees, intellectual  property and renewable energy assets.		

LAW BK 988: Mergers and Acquisitions
	This course deals with key issues that arise in bank mergers and acquisitions.  Business and transactional topics include: merger and acquisition strategies,  deal structure and pricing, hostile takeovers and defenses, duties of directors,  disclosure obligations, due diligence, mergers of equals, social issues, tax  considerations, and accounting issues. Regulatory topics include: federal and  state approval processes, regulatory considerations in the structuring of  transactions, antitrust considerations, interstate banking issues, the Community  Reinvestment Act, thrift and other nonbank acquisitions, Glass-Steagall and Bank  Holding Company Act issues, and cross-industry transactions. 		

LAW BK 990: Government Regulation of Insurance
	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), better known as health  care reform, is the most important  and controversial piece of federal social  legislation of this generation.  It is also basically an insurance regulatory  statute. PPACA establishes a new and complex set of rules governing the  operation of the health insurance industry, provides consumers with important  rights with respect to access to medical care and imposes obligations with  respect to health insurance on both businesses and individuals.  The course will  look at PPACA and the issues that surrounded its enactment--issues which  continue to fuel debate over whether it should modified or repealed. This will  be done as part of an examination of the regulatory rules that govern all of  insurance industry?s products (annuities, auto, home owners? product liability,  life insurance, etc).  The course also takes a look at the insurance industry?s  structure and financial performance and at the competitive interactions between  the insurance, banking and securities industries. The impact on the industry of  the financial crisis of 2008 and the resulting Dodd-Frank reform legislation  will be reviewed. 		

LAW BK 991: Commercial Lending
	This course studies the legal problems involved in documenting various types of  financing transactions ranging from short-term unsecured loans which are based  on the borrower's general credit to long-term, asset-based financings in which  the lender does not have recourse to the borrower's general assets. The  documentation process is followed from the preparation of the initial term sheet  through the rendering of legal opinions at closing. The major aspects of a loan  agreement, specifically representations and warranties, lending provisions,  closing conditions, pricing, covenants, and defaults, are studied in detail in  an effort to insure that each student understands the mechanics of a financing  transaction. The special legal problems involved in inventory and receivables  financing, project financing, construction credits, and leasing transactions are  highlighted. Subordination agreements, participation agreements, and other  inter-creditor arrangements are discussed. The provisions of the Bank Holding  Company Act that relate to financing transactions, bank legal lending limits,  margin requirements, and usury are considered. A discussion format is employed  to the extent feasible, and problems and illustrations are used to focus and  encourage class participation. The grade is based on a final examination, class  participation and a brief analytical paper.
