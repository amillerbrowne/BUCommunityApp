LAW BK 987: Securitization
	Securitization and structured finance together constitute one of the most  dynamic segments of the financial markets. Securitization involves the creation  and issuance of securities backed by one or more assets which generate cash  flows sufficient to fund the securities. Structured finance includes  securitization as well as transactions in which securities are not issued, but  which involve the often complex structuring of cash flows to achieve a desired  tax, accounting or financial objective. These transactions often cut across many  areas of legal specialization, including bank and thrift regulation, securities  regulation, taxation, bankruptcy and insolvency, fiduciary law, real estate law  and environmental law. This course examines a series of actual transactions to  explore the sometimes contradictory ways that these various legal constructs  impinge upon the structuring transactions. Examples include single-family  mortgage pools, trade receivable securitizations and commercial mortgage  securitizations. This course also explores some of the more cutting-edge  securitizations of exotic asset classes such as legal fees, intellectual  property and renewable energy assets.

LAW BK 990: Government Regulation of Insurance
	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), better known as health  care reform, is the most important  and controversial piece of federal social  legislation of this generation.  It is also basically an insurance regulatory  statute. PPACA establishes a new and complex set of rules governing the  operation of the health insurance industry, provides consumers with important  rights with respect to access to medical care and imposes obligations with  respect to health insurance on both businesses and individuals.  The course will  look at PPACA and the issues that surrounded its enactment--issues which  continue to fuel debate over whether it should modified or repealed. This will  be done as part of an examination of the regulatory rules that govern all of  insurance industry?s products (annuities, auto, home owners? product liability,  life insurance, etc).  The course also takes a look at the insurance industry?s  structure and financial performance and at the competitive interactions between  the insurance, banking and securities industries. The impact on the industry of  the financial crisis of 2008 and the resulting Dodd-Frank reform legislation  will be reviewed. 		

LAW BK 991: Commercial Lending
	This course studies the legal problems involved in documenting various types of  financing transactions ranging from short-term unsecured loans which are based  on the borrower's general credit to long-term, asset-based financings in which  the lender does not have recourse to the borrower's general assets. The  documentation process is followed from the preparation of the initial term sheet  through the rendering of legal opinions at closing. The major aspects of a loan  agreement, specifically representations and warranties, lending provisions,  closing conditions, pricing, covenants, and defaults, are studied in detail in  an effort to insure that each student understands the mechanics of a financing  transaction. The special legal problems involved in inventory and receivables  financing, project financing, construction credits, and leasing transactions are  highlighted. Subordination agreements, participation agreements, and other  inter-creditor arrangements are discussed. The provisions of the Bank Holding  Company Act that relate to financing transactions, bank legal lending limits,  margin requirements, and usury are considered. A discussion format is employed  to the extent feasible, and problems and illustrations are used to focus and  encourage class participation. The grade is based on a final examination, class  participation and a brief analytical paper.

LAW JD 783: Transaction Simulation: Int'l Business Collaboration
	This course is one of the "capstone" semester-long transaction simulations offered as part of the School's Transactional Law Program. The simulated transaction involves two companies, one a large U.S.-based pharmaceutical company, and the other an African company majority owned by the government. The two companies are interested in working together to produce and commercialize a plant-based product which may be effective in treating, and possibly even preventing, arthritis. The pharmaceutical company has developed and patented a process to extract the active ingredient from the plant which is available in ample supply from the African company. The form of their collaboration could be a joint venture, a licensing agreement or a long term supply contract.   For much of the course, the class will be divided into two teams, with each team representing one of the parties to the potential transaction.  Negotiations between the two teams will take place through written exchanges and real-time negotiation.  The course provides students with an opportunity to gain insight into the dynamics of negotiating and structuring business transactions, to learn about the role that lawyers, law and business play in these negotiations, and to develop experience in drafting communications and actual negotiations. Students will also learn about the legal and business issues that may arise in joint ventures, supply agreements and licensing agreements, particularly in an international transaction.  CLASS SIZE: Limited to 12 students (6 JD and 6 LLM). PREREQUISITES: Corporations and Contract Drafting (LLM students will take Transactional Contracts as a co-requisite in lieu of Contract Drafting). NOTES: This course does not satisfy the Upper-Class Writing Requirement. This course satisfies the Upper-Class Professional Skills Requirement.

LAW JD 784: Crossborder Litigation in Practice
	The course will expose students to the practical aspects of cross border litigation by examining in depth] the ongoing 20+ year legal conflict among Chevron, the State of Ecuador, the indigenous tribes of the Lago Agrio, and two leading American law firms over claims concerning the pollution of a 4,000 square kilometer area of Ecuador. Through the lens of this complex, multi-jurisdictional dispute, the class will examine the types of legal, business, strategic and political issues raised in such a high-profile, "bet the company" dispute, including the  Alien Tort Claims Act, the $9.5-billion judgment in Ecuador against Chevron, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the impact of bilateral investment treaties, and tactics employed in pursuit of and defense against the recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment.  Readings will include the "Invictus Memo" by which Patton Boggs set out a settlement strategy for the plaintiffs and the ruling in the RICO litigation against the plaintiff's lawyers. By the end of the course, students will have an understanding the resources required and the challenges faced in pursuing multi-jurisdiction claims against a multinational corporation. 		

LAW JD 785: Federal Civil Practice (S)
	This seminar will focus on the specific application of the federal rules of civil procedure to pretrial civil practice.  Each pretrial phase of a case (from the complaint to the answer to motions to dismiss to discovery to summary judgment) will be unpacked with reference to the applicable civil rules.  The idea is to reach the same level of detail in analysis and close reading of the rules as that required of a new litigation associate.  This will involve considerations of computation of time, deadlines, pleading rules, Rule 12, Rule 16, Rule 26, the local rules of civil procedure, and the like.  The class will proceed with students drafting and discussing the various documents relevant to pretrial procedure.  From a prewritten factual scenario, students will draft complaints, answer their colleagues' complaints, move to dismiss their colleagues' complaints, draft discovery documents, move for summary judgment, etc.  Grades will be derived from classroom discussion and written product.  NOTES: This seminar does not satisfy the Upper-class Writing Requirement.  This seminar satisfies the Upper-class Professional Skills requirement.

The clinic gives students the opportunity to develop and apply a variety of legal skills to the legislative process. Clinic participants work on several projects during the semester that highlight different aspects of the legislative process, allowing students to relate and test the theories discussed in class to real life situations.		

LAW JD 788: Contract Drafting
	This course is the foundational skills course within the Transactional Law Program.  It teaches students basic principles and skills of drafting and analyzing commercial and transaction agreements, with a focus on recognizing, and addressing through contractual provisions, key business issues in transactions.  Although the course will be of particular interest to students interested in a corporate or transactional law practice, since most practicing attorneys will need to work with contracts at some point in their career, the concepts and skills which the course conveys are applicable to virtually all practice areas and specialties.  While the course utilizes lectures to introduce various contract concepts and techniques essential for drafting and reviewing commercial and transaction agreements, it requires that students complete in-class exercises and extensive homework assignments as a means of building basic drafting skills and a solid understanding of the structure and operation of contractual provisions in a business transaction.  Grades will be based on the graded assignments, good faith completion of ungraded assignments, and class participation.  ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 12 students.  NOTE:  This class satisfies the Upper-class Professional Skills requirement. GRADING NOTICE:  This class will not offer the CR/NC/H option.

Rather than broadly surveying the landscape, we will closely examine a cluster of topics that have especially challenged courts, legislatures, and theorists.  Particular topics will be determined prior to the start of class, but might include:  copyright law's treatment of intermediaries (such as YouTube, file sharing services, and online service providers); the obligations of auction sites and other online services to police trademark infringement by their users; the scope of fair use protection for user-generated content; and patent protection for Internet-related technologies and business methods. Grades will be based on a combination of written exercises (required each week) and oral presentations (required once for each student).  Student participation is required, and will be taken into account in the grade for the course.  In lieu of the short papers, it is possible to write a paper that satisfies the Upper-class Writing Requirement.

LAW JD 793: Trade Secrets and Restrictive Covenants
	This course will examine the theory, practice, and interrelationship of trade secret law and the law of restrictive covenants, including laws governing the use and enforceability of noncompetition agreements.  We will explore what a trade secret is, what it is not, how it differs from other types of intellectual property, and how something secret can constitute protectable property.  We will investigate how trade secrets can be misappropriated, including misappropriation through one's memory; whether and in what circumstances trade secrets will be protected, including through the use of noncompetition agreements, nondisclosure agreements, and other restrictive covenants; the other purposes served by those agreements; and the strengths and weaknesses of the various laws governing the protection of trade secrets and the use of restrictive covenants.  Depending on class interest and time, we may discuss related issues such as the current debate over the use of noncompete agreements and their putative effects on innovation.  NOTE: This course satisfies the upper-class professional skills requirement.  GRADING NOTICE: This course does not offer the CR/NC/H option.  OFFERING PATTERN: This class is not offered every year.

LAW JD 795: E-DISCOVERY LAW &amp; PRACTICE
	 The Electronic Discovery Reference Model, or EDRM, sets out the basic work steps required to move Electronically Stored Information, or ESI, from its original location on a client's computer systems, through Identification, Preservation, Collection, Processing, Review, Production, Analysis and Presentation in a legal setting.  Each step along the EDRM has both legal standards set out in statutory and case law, as well as best practices for how to implement those standards in practical work plans.  This course will address both the legal requirements and practical work required to move data from its natural habitat into a legal action.  In other words, we will address the law and practical steps required for civil ediscovery.  In addition to class lecture and discussion, this course will include in class exercises where the students will form work groups and apply ediscovery law to hypotheticals, and work together with technical tools, with the assistance of visiting ESI technical specialists.

LAW JD 805: Business Law: Secured Financing Transactions
	Many commercial financing transactions involve the creation of security interests in the borrower's personal property that are akin to mortgages of real property.  Much business credit is provided on a secured credit - if security is unavailable, credit markets can dry up.  Additionally, the debt obligation can be packaged with others and serve as the backing for securities akin to those that have recently been much in the news.  This course governs the basic secured transaction governed by Article 9 of the U.C.C.  Topics covered will include creation and perfection of security interests, priority contests, and the consequences of default.  There are no PREREQUISITES for this course.

LAW JD 806: Prosecutorial Ethics (S)
	United States Attorney (and later Supreme Court Justice) Robert Jackson noted in a speech that a "prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and reputation than any other person in America."  This seminar will analyze the unique role, power, and responsibilities of the prosecutor in the United States criminal justice system.  How does a prosecutor balance her duty to "seek justice" and her role as a "minister of justice" within an adversarial system?  Does public pressure (perceived or real) to obtain convictions and solve crimes have an impact on prosecutors' actions?   Throughout this course, we will examine the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, the Model Code of Professional Responsibility, and the Standards of Criminal Justice as they apply to criminal attorneys in general and prosecutors in particular.  How do the rules and case law demonstrate that a criminal prosecutor is different from a criminal defense attorney or civil attorney?  We will study the ethical implications and constraints placed on prosecutors, as well as the unique power that they hold at various stages of a criminal case.  We will examine the means by which a prosecutor exercises discretion from the investigation of alleged crimes to the decision to charge (or not charge), and through the conduct of trials, as well as post-trial obligations.  We will address such topics as: What is the prosecutor's obligation to the police and/or alleged victims of crimes?  What duty does a prosecutor owe to a criminal defendant?  What restrictions are placed on a prosecutor at trial that do not exist for defense attorneys?  We will also study some specific contemporary and historical cases that have raised questions about the ethical conduct of prosecutors, including (but not limited to) the so-called Duke Lacrosse case, the Dominque Strauss-Kahn matter, and the prosecution of United States Senator Ted Stevens and the subsequent findings of prosecutorial misconduct therein.   NOTE:  This seminar satisfies the Professional Responsibility requirement.  While there are no required prerequisites for taking this course, students should be prepared that some basic principles of Criminal Procedure, Evidence, and Trial Advocacy will necessarily be a focus of some of our discussions. ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 18 students.

LAW JD 817: Advanced Human Trafficking
	In the Advanced Human Trafficking Seminar, students will examine the complexities of multidisciplinary legal practice in the human trafficking context. These topics will be explored through the use of case rounds and the discussion of issues arising in cases handled by the student attorneys. Topics will include the ethics of engaging with other professionals (e.g., social workers, medical professionals, etc.) as well as how to approach legal issues with a multi-disciplinary lens. For example, in the human trafficking context, courts have adopted diversion programs and "John" schools to alleviate the harsh implications of the criminal justice system while providing more effective protection to human trafficking survivors. Students will examine these approaches and the limitations of various models.  Requirements include active class participation, journals, and a final paper.		

LAW JD 818: Advanced Human Trafficking (C)
	Students will continue to represent human trafficking survivors in a variety of contexts. They will be expected to contribute ten hours per week to represent human trafficking survivors.

LAW JD 822: Privacy (S)
	Modern information technology and new information-intensive businesses and social practices have moved privacy concerns into the spotlight.  And though privacy law has existed as a legal practice area for a generation or more, laws and practice in the area are increasingly complex and evolving rapidly. This course examines law and policy issues concerning personal information and privacy. Law enforcement, national security, and other public law topics will be considered, but the main focus will be civil law and the use of personally identifying information by businesses. We will consider privacy-related statutes and regulations; a variety of recent controversies drawing from Constitutional law, contract, and tort law; established privacy regimes in the EU and elsewhere; and emerging laws that have implications for the use and protection of personal information globally.

LAW JD 824: Juvenile Delinquency (S)
	The American juvenile justice system was established over one hundred years ago to address the problem of young offenders.  This course examines the historical, social and legal foundations for our current system.  We will examine the issue of "rights" as applied to children and  look at the effects of ideology and politics on the current juvenile justice system.  How have assumptions of childhood and responsibility changed?  Has the juvenile court been "criminalized" with the introduction of due process rights for children?  Under what circumstances are children treated as adult offenders?  Selected issues for inquiry include: police interrogation of juveniles; school safety and zero tolerance policies; adjudicative competency; anti-youth crime policies; conditions of incarceration; and changes brought about by elimination of mandatory juvenile life without parole.  We will examine these issues through use of court cases, law review articles, governmental and private organizational position papers,  and legislative history.  Using the Massachusetts model, one of the early and often emulated juvenile systems, we will examine the changes in the prosecution and incarceration of juveniles over the past century.  As we consider the overarching issue of whether it makes sense to maintain a separate justice system for juveniles, we will compare our system to those of other nations.  We will visit the Boston Juvenile Court to observe a delinquency session and speak with court personnel.  Students are expected to attend each class prepared to discuss the assigned readings.  Course requirements include a 15-20 page final paper, a class presentation based on the paper topic or related class readings, and several assigned reading response papers over the course of the semester.

LAW JD 826: Mediation: Theory &amp; Practice (S)
	Mediation is part of the legal landscape in almost every substantive area and legal setting.  This course will cover the theory and practice of mediation, the use of mediation to resolve disputes in various different legal contexts, and the development of practical mediation skills.  We will examine the mediation process from the role of the mediator through the attorney representing a party in mediation.  We will also address direct negotiation, the decision to mediate, mediator selection, preparation for mediation, and ethical issues involved in negotiation.  The course will provide skill building through several interactive role-plays, in which students will have opportunities to act as a mediator, a party in mediation, and counsel to a party in mediation.  The role play mediations and other exercises will survey many of the areas in which mediation is being used, including business and commercial; court-connected, federal-state agency (environmental and others); construction, employment/workplace; family/ divorce; school, community, and international.  Due to the interactive nature of the class, students will be expected to attend all scheduled classes and to participate actively.

LAW JD 827: Restorative Justice: Principles and Practices
	The course explores the needs of key stakeholders in a justice system (victims, offenders, communities, government officials), outlines the basic principles and values of restorative justice with comparisons to the principles and values of retributive justice, and introduces some of the primary models of practice.  It also identifies challenges to restorative justice.  These discussions will takes place in the context of secular and religious understandings of justice.  The course is organized around the issue of crime and harm within a western legal context.  However, attention is given to applications and lessons from other contexts.  Of particular interest is the contribution of traditional or indigenous approaches to justice as well as applications in post-conflict situations, such as South Africa.  The class will include presentations by the instructor, class discussion of the assigned reading, conversations with victims, offenders and community members, and role plays of different practices.  The class will include students from both the Law School and the School of Theology. Students will be graded on the basis of their written work and classroom performance.  There will be no final exam.		

LAW JD 828: Wrongful Convictions Clinic (C)
	Participants will engage in screening applications from prisoners claiming innocence who have requested help from the New England Innocence Project.  This may involve reading prisoner questionnaires, pleadings and court opinions in the case, legal research and analysis of the requirements for obtaining a new trial, review of attorney files, and search for forensic evidence in the case. Clinic students must attend biweekly meetings as determined necessary by Mr. Cormier, and spend at least five hours a week on Clinic tasks, under supervision, for the full academic year.  If investigation of the prisoner's case finishes at the end of the Fall Semester, or part-way through the Spring Semester, the Clinic work will end at that time.  Most often, however, Clinic obligations continue throughout the academic year. Students will receive one pass/fail credit for each full semester of work.  If, however, work on the prisoner's case is not finished by December, credit for the Fall will be deferred until the work is completed.  Hours spent on Clinic work in the Spring semester that do not receive credit may be counted toward satisfaction of the School's Pro Bono Pledge. Participants will be expected to attend an evening orientation program, conducted in late September at the New England Innocence Project. Interested students may obtain an application online at http://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/programs/clinics/applying/ and submit it to Mr. Cormier at pc@gscboston.com.  The application deadline is May 15, 2014. NOTES: This Clinic satisfies the upper-class professional skills requirement.  Enrolling in this Clinic will not disadvantage participants who wish to enroll in other law school clinics, either contemporaneously or subsequently.		

LAW JD 830: Federal Habeas Corpus (S)
	This seminar explores federal court jurisdiction to entertain petitions for the writ of habeas corpus. Some attention will be given to habeas corpus as a means of challenging actions taken by the Federal Government in connection with national security and immigration.  More attention will be given to habeas as the means by which state and federal prisoners attack criminal convictions and death sentences. The seminar should be of interest to students interested in the institutional role of federal courts in the United States, the relationship between federal courts and state courts, and the procedural mechanisms for adjudicating federal constitutional issues in criminal cases.  Students who plan to practice criminal law, to handle capital litigation, or to clerk for federal judges will find the seminar especially valuable.  ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar, or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, will be administratively dropped from the seminar. Students who wait list for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment.   		

LAW JD 831: Evidence
	Practical and theoretical aspects of the rules of evidence.  The purpose and policies underlying the evidentiary rules are stressed throughout in order to make the rules meaningful, predictable, and functional both for students interested in trial practice and for students who anticipate engaging in a more diversified practice.  In addition to covering the substantive rules of evidence, the course demonstrates the significance of evidence as a tactical device at the trial and as a vital skill for the office lawyer. GRADING NOTICE:  Judge Lowy's section will not offer the CR/NC/H option.		

LAW JD 833: Environmental Law
	This is an introductory survey class in environmental law. Topics include the control of air and water pollution, toxic substances and hazardous waste, global climate change,  brownfields development, the intersection between energy law and policy and environmental law, protection of endangered species, and  judicial review of federal and state administrative actions. We will also study one or more current examples of environmental law in action to illustrate the differing interests of various stakeholders in environmental law disputes. Administrative Law is recommended but not required as a prerequisite. GRADING NOTICE: This class does not offer the CR/NC/H option		

LAW JD 834: Employment Discrimination and Employment Law
	The course focuses on race, sex, age, and disability employment discrimination prohibitions. Affirmative action, religious discrimination, constitutional protections of public sector workers, anti-retaliation and whistleblower laws, and common law protection against arbitrary dismissals are also covered. Important procedural issues, including arbitration, are highlighted.		

LAW JD 836: Federal Courts
	A basic survey course, covering the federal courts and their conduct of litigation concerning business regulation, environmental protection, and civil rights.  This course picks up where the first-year course in Civil Procedure leaves off and complements other courses on modern regulation and legal institutions: e.g., Administrative Law, Environmental Law, Labor Law, Conflict of Laws, and Constitutional Law.  Topics include the prerequisites for gaining access to the federal district courts and the United States Supreme Court, the relationship between the federal courts and state courts, and "abstention" doctrines governing the exercise of federal judicial power.  Especially recommended for students who plan to practice with firms that represent clients subject to federal regulation, to pursue careers with federal or state agencies and departments, or to handle constitutional, civil rights, or other public interest litigation.		

LAW JD 838: Antitrust Law
	Antitrust law regulates the competition between business firms in unregulated markets (and in varying degrees in regulated markets, where it supplies a benchmark standard).  Thus, all privately owned economic entities are subject to or affected by the antitrust laws (federal or state), ranging from the largest multinationals to self-employed individuals, e.g., lawyers.  Antitrust law constrains business behavior that injures the competitive process, encompassing such topics as price fixing, boycotts, monopolization, mergers, price discrimination, distributorship limitations and similar trade restrictions.  Antitrust analysis is increasingly economic in its orientation and therefore economic analysis will form a vital part of the course.  Supplementary economic readings are suggested for students without previous economic background (and for others who may wish to refresh their knowledge).  GRADING NOTICE:  This class will not offer the CR/NC/H option.		

LAW JD 839: First Amendment
	This course will begin with an examination of freedom of expression and freedom of the press and will then move to a study of freedom of religion -- the establishment clause and the free exercise clause. We shall cover issues such as the protection of political speech, sexualized speech (obscenity and pornography), symbolic speech and speech in public places in addition to issues related to press censorship, reporters' privilege and press coverage of trials. We shall pay particular attention to the WikiLeaks case and examine the role of leaks, reporters' privilege and the internet in the 21 century. In the area of freedom of religion we shall review the evolving jurisprudence on the role of religion in the public sphere as well as the constitutional command to guarantee free exercise of religion.  While studying the doctrines developed under the Bill of Rights, we shall also address theoretical questions such as the justifications for freedom of expression, the role of religion in American culture, the role of rights in constitutional democracy and the institutional question of judicial review. GRADING NOTICE: This class does not offer the CR/NC/H option.		

LAW JD 841: Sup Res&amp;Writing
			

LAW JD 842: International Business Transactions
	This course is intended to introduce students to the many legal issues generated by international business transactions and related international trade.  With the significant growth in international commerce and trade, and the powerful forces of economic and social globalization, there is an increasing likelihood that lawyers will confront international commercial legal issues more frequently during their professional careers.  The aim in this course is to generate vigorous learning and discussion of the many legal and related commercial and prudential issues that arise in international business transactions. Upon successful completion of this course, students will have a better understanding of the primary role of the lawyer in international transactional practice, acting as a practical, ethical and prudential legal advisor, while working to maximize value and reduce risk for the client in conditions of inherent risk and uncertainty.  Topics include formation of contracts, choice of law, financing the international sale of goods through letters of credit, regulation of international trade including export and import controls, the organizations and operations of the institutions of the World Trade Organization, licensing of intellectual property; international antitrust; foreign investment, investment in free trade areas such as the European Union, international dispute settlement, and international transfer of intellectual property. A number of sessions will be devoted to analyzing transactional instruments, such as letters of credit, distribution agreements, technology licenses, and joint venture agreements.		

LAW JD 844: Charity &amp; Charitable Organizations (S)
	 This seminar will focus on the unique legal status of charitable organizations.  Particular attention will be given to the expansion of charitable institutions from relief of poor people to different types of non-profit entities (including universities, hospitals, and religious organizations).  We will examine their organization, governance, and regulation by both the federal government and the states.  Specific topics will include the permissible scope of non-profit activities; choice of organizational form; the powers and fiduciary duties of non-profit directors/trustees and officers; standing to sue non-profits; qualification for federal tax-exempt status and related tax issues; forms of charitable giving and the regulation of fundraising; the investment and use of charitable funds; and other issues unique to non-profits.  All students will be required to write papers on topics approved by the instructor. Some students, with the permission of the instructor, may satisfy the Upper-class Writing Requirement through this seminar by writing a longer paper. ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 18 students. GRADING NOTICE:  This class will not offer the CR/NC/H option. OFFERING PATTERN: This class not offered every year.  Students are advised to take this into account when planning their long-term schedule. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar, or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, will be administratively dropped from the seminar. Students who wait list for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment.  		

LAW JD 846: Historical Perspectives on Law, Constitutions and Culture (S)
	This workshop-format seminar examines the interplay of law, constitutions, and culture from an historical perspective.  The heart of the seminar is student engagement with works-in-progress by leading scholars in the history, theory, and culture of law, broadly understood.  The first three class sessions will be devoted to developing the intellectual tools necessary for reading and engaging with such papers.  Starting in week 4 of the semester, the class format will alternate between workshop sessions and more traditional seminar sessions.  During the five workshop sessions, an invited scholar will present a current scholarly work-in-progress for discussion.  Students will read the speaker's paper in advance and prepare discussion questions for the seminar.  During the other sessions, the class will meet as a normal seminar, during which we will discuss readings related to the workshop papers and legal history more generally.  The written work for the seminar will consist of a series of brief, critical essays in response to a student-selected subset of the workshop papers. NOTE:  This course is open to law students and to graduate students from other departments.  A background in history is not a prerequisite.  Graduate students from outside the law school may be able to receive 4 credits for this course. Please consult the professor regarding this option. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.  Students who are on a wait list for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment.		

LAW JD 847: Federal Courts
	This course focuses on the statutory, constitutional, and judge-made doctrines that shape and restrict the powers of federal courts.  In particular, it examines the relationships between the federal courts and the other branches of the federal government, as well as the relationship between the federal and state courts.  Selected topics include standing and justiciability, congressional control of the federal courts' powers (such as the extent to which "enemy combatants" may be excluded from federal court), federal question jurisdiction, and state sovereign immunity from suit in federal and state courts.  This course builds extensively on topics covered in Constitutional Law and Civil Procedure.  It is strongly recommended for students who plan on clerking (especially for a federal judge) or who expect to represent clients in federal court or in civil actions against government actors.		

LAW JD 850: Insurance Law
	 The presence or absence of insurance is in many instances the single most important determinant of whether and how a tort or contracts action is litigated. This course focuses on both individual and commercial forms of insurance coverage. Students are introduced to the key insurance concepts of risk management, including the transfer, pooling and allocation of covered risks. Problems of contract interpretation, imperfect information, adverse selection and discrimination will be treated at length. Additionally, the class will take up issues particular to property, life, health, disability, liability and auto insurance. Finally, some time will be devoted to the state regulatory regimes designed to ensure solvency and profitability, and to the secondary market (i.e. reinsurance, and surplus and excess lines). A final exam is required.		

LAW JD 852: Mutual Funds (Investment Companies)
	Investment companies have become an important part of the financial system. This course is designed to familiarize students with the special laws governing investment companies: their creation, structure, corporate governance, operations (including the distribution of shares and the management of the portfolios), dissolution and, time permitting, taxation. In particular, the course will focus on the Investment Company Act of 1940 and on the practice in this area before the Securities and Exchange Commission.		

LAW JD 854: White Collar Crime
	The past several years have witnessed an explosion in white collar criminal prosecutions: Arthur Andersen, Martha Stewart, Bernard Madoff and Jeffrey Skilling (Enron) to name a few.  The purpose of this Course is to teach present-day "white collar crime" practice, including the elements of principal federal statutes and the special procedures followed by prosecutors.  The course will review the theoretical bases of modern "white collar crime" prosecution, the major statutes in a prosecutor's "tool-box" (mail and wire fraud, securities fraud, bribery and extortion, obstruction of justice, RICO, and perjury) and procedural aspects of white collar crime (such as, grand jury process and sentencing).  Students will learn significant and interesting recent cases and the prosecutorial and defensive techniques employed in white collar crime cases.  Upon successful completion of the course, students will be familiar with the statutes, procedures, and methods of issue analysis employed by prosecutors and private lawyers in "white collar crime" practice.  OFFERING PATTERN: This class not offered every year.  Students are advised to take this into account when planning their long-term schedule.		

LAW JD 855: Land Use
	This course covers a wide range of laws, regulations, and policy considerations that influence and govern the development of land.  Classes will focus on real-world projects, including adaptive re-use of a historic building and construction of a high-rise tower, to explore the complex legal work that underpins modern real estate projects.  Readings will include a mix of project-specific legal documents and casebook readings.  Specific topics will include historic preservation, zoning and permitting, title and due diligence, eminent domain, real estate finance, easements and licenses, and environmental and "green building" issues.  Readings and discussion will build on core property law concepts but there are no pre-requisites for this course.		

LAW JD 857: Intellectual Property
	This course explores how the law deals with the products of creative activity.  The range of subject matter is large, embracing things as different as mechanical inventions and melodies; baubles and boat designs; catalogues, computers and cartoons.  Among the areas of potential coverage are federal copyright law, federal trademark law, state law theories of unfair competition, trade secret law, patent law, state rights of publicity, and misappropriation.  Also considered will be whether federal law should preempt the efforts of state judges and legislatures to regulate intellectual products.		

LAW JD 861: Civil Litigation Program (C)
	The Civil Litigation Program gives students the opportunity to use their lawyering skills in all courtroom levels - from local trial and housing courts, to the state's Supreme Judicial Court, to the federal court. In fact, several landmark decisions by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court began as student-represented cases in the Civil Litigation Program.   Students in the Civil Litigation Clinic choose from three options:  *Housing, Employment, Family and Disability Clinic (HEFD) (full-year program) - The average HEFD clinic caseload over two semesters typically includes 4-5 cases in areas such as domestic relations, eviction defense, employment law and Social Security appeals.  Other kinds of cases may also be assigned.   *Immigration Rights Clinic (IRC) (full-year program) - The average IRC clinic caseload over two semesters typically includes two asylum or humanitarian/refugee related cases, and a significant research project.  *Employment Rights Clinic (ERC) (one semester program, fall or spring) - Students will represent clients in unemployment compensation cases, and a possibility of working on wage and hour disputes, discrimination/sexual harassment cases, and Family Medical Leave Act cases.   PREREQUISITE/COREQUISITE (HEFD &amp; IRC OPTIONS):  If you have not already done so, you must take Evidence during the first semester to satisfy the student practice rule. If you have already taken Trial Advocacy, you will still need to take the clinical section. It is closely integrated with your field work. PREREQUISITE/COREQUISITE (ERC OPTION): Spring ERC students must take Evidence and Professional Responsibility concurrently with the Employment Rights Clinic, or students must have already taken these courses.  Fall ERC students must take Evidence concurrently, or have already taken this course. NOTE: This clinic satisfies the upper-class professional skills requirement.  		

LAW JD 862: Client Counseling (S)
	The purpose of this seminar is to provide students with the opportunity to develop client counseling skills needed to deal with a wide variety of clients and their various problems.  The focus of the seminar is on the way in which students are able to guide, listen, and counsel a client rather than on the correctness of the legal analysis.  This seminar is designed for students to learn by engaging in mock client counseling interviews.  Accordingly, much of the time will be filled with practice interviews and discussion of strategies for how to navigate client interviews and meetings.  This class is designed for the "real world" and will also prepare students for the ABA client counseling competition.  ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 18 students. GRADING NOTICE:  All students will be graded CR/NC/H. NOTES:  This seminar does not satisfy the Upper-class Writing Requirement. This seminar satisfies the Upper-class Professional Skills requirement.  ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.  Students who are on a wait list for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment.		

LAW JD 864: Government Regulation of Financial Services
	This course will compare the legal and regulatory frameworks for the four major types of financial institutions in the United States: banks, broker-dealers, investment companies and insurance companies.  The course will identify the essential economic activities of each type of financial institution and, in so doing, provide the context within which students can understand the fundamental purposes that underlie the legal rules that govern in each area.  This study will draw comparisons and contrasts among the different regulatory approaches that apply.  The course will explore the different forms of regulation that govern financial institutions, including disclosure rules, prohibitions or restrictions aimed at potential conflicts of interest, limitations on activities, capital requirements, limits on risk taking, price regulation and corporate governance requirements.  Attendance at the Graduate Program in Banking and Financial Law's two-day program, "Financial Services Basics," is highly recommended. Contact their office to confirm dates and to register.		

LAW JD 867: Health Law
	This course focuses on the organization, financing, and provision of medical care, including a number of provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Topics and themes include the economics of health insurance and managed care, regulatory responses to the market's perceived failures, medical tort law, access to care, consumer choice and patient autonomy, defining and assessing quality, and health care providers' conflicts of interest. 		

LAW JD 868: Moot Court
	The second component of the First Year Research and Writing requirement is participation in the J. Newton Esdaile Appellate Moot Court Program in the spring semester. Students conduct research, draft a brief and present a case in oral argument before a panel of moot-court judges made up of faculty, lawyers and students.   		

LAW JD 870: Patent Law
	The basic questions in patent law are:  why should society permit the grant of an exclusive property right in information relating to an invention? Who should be given the right? What is the scope of the right? How should the right be enforced? What disclosure duties should be placed on the patent holder? We will concentrate on these legal issues without getting mired in discussions of the technical details of particular inventions. Students without a technical background are welcome and encouraged to enroll.   		

LAW JD 871: Trusts, Wills &amp; Basic Estate Planning
	Examination of the rules governing intestate and testate distribution of property including formal requirements governing execution, alteration and revocation of wills; requisite elements of express trusts and requirements for their creation; resulting trusts and constructive trusts; special rules relating to charitable trusts and spendthrift trusts; rules concerning construction of wills and trusts; and general rules governing administration of decedents' estates and trusts. Short drafting assignments will be distributed throughout the semester.  A special one-credit drafting supplement may be arranged for a small number of students to work with an adjunct instructor on longer drafting projects. 		

LAW JD 872: Financial Reporting for Lawyers
	Understanding financial statements and reports.  The objective of the course is that students will be able to read and understand the four financial statements and the 10-k annual report.  Emphasis is placed on understanding the nature and meaning of the reports, as well as the relationship to the underlying transactions.  Other topics include: basic accounting principles, US GAAP versus IFRS, financial statement analysis, the relationship of the financial statement information to covenant documents, and accounting gamesmanship.  RESTRICTION:  Not open to students who have had more than one three-hour college course, or its equivalent, in accounting.		

LAW JD 873: Civil Procedure
	Examines the structure and function of civil procedure and the requirements of due process of law.		

LAW JD 874: Advanced Legal Writing and Editing Workshop (S)
	The purpose of this seminar is to provide students with the opportunity to improve their writing, editing and communication skills.  Students will prepare a variety of practice related documents based on a single fact pattern.  Some legal research will be necessary, but the emphasis will be on writing, not on research.  Students will also have the opportunity to edit other students' papers, with the goal of improving their own writing skills. Actors will perform a scenario for the class, from which students will extract the pertinent facts.  From this fact pattern, students will draft an inter-office memo, a letter or memo to a non-lawyer client, and a trial or appellate brief. Students will also engage in simulated client interviewing and counseling sessions, as well as a simulated meeting with a supervisor. Students will be graded on the basis of their written work, editing work on their classmate's papers and on their classroom performance.  There will be no final exam.  NOTES: This seminar does not satisfy the Upper-class Writing Requirement.  This seminar satisfies the Upper-class Professional Skills Requirement. GRADING NOTICE:  This class will not offer the CR/NC/H option. ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 16 students. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar. Students who are on a wait list for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment.		

LAW JD 875: Human Rights Lawyering (S)
	This seminar is designed to introduce students to the range of human rights advocacy, grounded in the history of human rights movements, the development of international human rights norms, and contemporary case studies. The seminar will also look at the role critical theory has played and continues to play in shaping the development of human rights. In addition to examining the law and theory that underlies human rights movements, students will engage in human rights research and simulations.  The course work and final paper/project will require students to conduct research, develop strategic advocacy plans, and draft documents aimed at advancing particular human rights issues.  There are no prerequisites, though an introductory course in international law would be beneficial. Class participation is mandatory.  In lieu of mid-term or final examination, students will complete a final project / paper of their selection. An introductory class in International Human Rights is highly recommended, though not required. LIMITED WRITING REQUIREMENT OPTION: A limited number of students may be permitted to satisfy the upper-class writing requirement.  GRADING NOTICE: This course does not offer the CR/NC/H option.    ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar, or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, will be administratively dropped from the seminar.

LAW JD 876: Property
	Conceptual analysis and underlying policy considerations in basic property law.		

LAW JD 877: Civil Rights Litigation
	This course is about the enforcement of constitutional rights and other federal rights against government officials.  The primary focus is on civil rights litigation in federal courts against state officials under the civil rights statutes passed in the wake of the civil war, including 42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1983, 1981, 1982 and 1985.  Under these statutes will look at which rights give rise to civil rights action and, to a much smaller extent, the scope of those rights.  The kinds of cases include police brutality, unlawful searches and seizures and discrimination in government jobs.  The issues that arise include many statutory questions, such as identification of proper parties to 1983 actions, and judge-make defenses, such as official and state immunities from damages actions and injunctive suits.  We will also look at federalism and eleventh amendment limitations on congressional power and federal court remedial power in 1983 actions, although coverage of these issues will not be as thorough as in Federal Courts.  The standards for holding local governments liable for damages will also be examined.  Our major foray into the substance of constitutional rights will be with regard to the role of state remedies and defendant's state of mind for fourteenth amendment procedural due process violations.  We will also look at substantive constitutional rights such as police brutality, medical care for prisoners and detainees, high speed police chases and other similar areas.  There will also be some coverage of remedies against federal officials directly under the constitution and remedies against private individuals for civil rights violations. OFFERING PATTERN: This class is not offered every year.  Students are advised to take this into account when planning their long-term schedule.		

LAW JD 878: THE COLOR LINE (S)
	This seminar traces the role of race and ethnicity in American law and social practice from the early colonial period to the present, including resistance to racial subordination and movements for reform.  While the seminar will mainly focus on the experiences of Native Americans, African Americans, Latino Americans, and Asian Americans, we will also consider the reception of Catholic and Jewish immigrants, America's overseas empire, and the legacy of white supremacy.  Readings will include Ronald Takaki, A Different Mirror (revised edn., 2008) and a course pack.  Seminar members will take turns initiating discussion of the readings. A term paper will be required on an approved topic.  A complete and polished draft of the paper will be revised in light of comments received.  (An expanded term paper, completed after the semester, can be the basis for satisfying the upper-class writing requirement.) ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 18 students.  ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.  Students who are on a wait list for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment.		

LAW JD 879: Advanced Legal Research
	In this class students will be exposed to how legal research functions in practice.  The class will be structured like a legal workplace with students in the role of new attorneys completing research projects for senior attorneys.  The research projects will be designed to highlight major legal research tools in both online and print formats.  The projects will feature tasks like locating court documents, doing a legislative history, finding agency regulations and guidance, doing state specific research with practice series, researching an unfamiliar area of the law using secondary sources, as well as learning to use Lexis/Nexis, Westlaw and Bloomberg Law in a cost effective manner.  The projects will require different output depending on the nature of the assignment from a short e-mail with the name of a case to a one-page memo highlighting recent developments in an area of law.  The objective of the class is for students to become comfortable completing simple and complex research in a work setting.  There will be several research projects throughout the semester and at least one oral exam.  NOTE:  This course does not satisfy the Upper-class Writing Requirement. This course satisfies the upper-class professional skills requirement.   This course meets January 22 through April 9.

In this highly interactive class, students will examine a variety of dispute resolution processes, other than traditional court adjudication, including negotiation, mediation, arbitration, and to a lesser extent, collaborative law, dispute resolution system design and restorative justice. Over the course of the semester, students will engage in a series of exercises (i.e., role-plays) through which they can develop and hone their skills and approaches to dispute resolution. Discussion and short lectures will accompany the exercises, as appropriate. There will be short written assignments (1-2 pages) in which students reflect upon and analyze their performance in the exercises, as well as a longer paper due at the end of the semester. No final exam.  ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 18 students.  NOTE:  This course satisfies the Upper-class Professional Skills requirement. GRADING NOTICE:  This class will not offer the CR/NC/H option.

LAW JD 924: Legal Externship Program: Fieldwork (C)
	The Legal Externship Program is a one semester clinical program where students work for credit at a public interest, for profit company, judicial or government organization. Through the program, students gain hands-on legal experience under the supervision of practitioners who are experts in their fields. Students receive variable credits (pass/fail) for the fieldwork component of the externship, determined as follows: 3 credits = 150 hours total; 4 credits = 200 hours total; and 5 credits = 250 hours total.  The student's schedule and hours are determined in consulation with the placement supervisors. Some placements require 250 hours. The fieldwork begins the first week of classes and students work through the last week of classes. Students may not begin the fieldwork before the semester begins.  Upon acceptance, Professor Lois Knight works with students to identify suitable field placements depending on each student's individual interests and career goals. Once possible placement organizations are identified, students are responsible for applying to those organizations.  Although there are no formal prequisites, some classes are highly recommended. For any litigation-based placement, you should have taken Evidence. For any criminal placement, in particular the criminal division of the US Attorney's Office, you should have taken Criminal Procedure. Additionally, you should take any other substantive law class that will help you understand the law related to your placement. For example, if you want to work at an environmental placement, you should take an environmental law class. COREQUISITE: Legal Externship Program: Legal Ethics (JD 925).

LAW JD 927: International Law
	This course will offer a basic survey of contemporary international law. It will teach students the minimum that every lawyer should know about the major issues of public international law and policy that influence current events and modern legal practice. It will also provide a foundation for those interested in further study of particular topics covered. We will consider both the historical "law of nations" and post-World War II developments, which have shifted the fulcrum of the system from an exclusive focus on the rights and duties of states inter se to a broader focus on all the diverse participants in the contemporary international legal process: not only states but intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations, insurgents, multinational business enterprises, terrorist and criminal associations, and individuals. Specific topics will include: (i) the history, nature, sources and efficacy of international law; (ii) the establishment, transformation and termination of states and other actors, including international institutions and, in particular, the United Nations; (iii) the domestic incorporation of international law, with a focus on key concepts of U.S. foreign relations law; (iv) the allocation among states of jurisdiction to prescribe and apply law, as well as jurisdictional immunities; (v) human rights, the laws of war, and international criminal law; (vi) the allocation of control over and regulation of the resources of the planet, including the law of the sea, territory, the environment, and the global economy; and (vii) the use of force. The role of power in the international legal system will be candidly acknowledged-and the problems and opportunities it presents explored. Current international events will be woven into the curriculum as appropriate. Examination.		

LAW JD 928: Shareholder Activism (S)
	In recent years, shareholder activism has transformed the way public companies are run.  Many shareholders are no longer content to passively defer to senior managers and boards of directors while quietly collecting their dividends and hoping for share price appreciation.  This course will explore various forms of shareholder activism.  We will examine the debate over proxy access and its successful inclusion in Dodd-Frank, say-on-pay initiatives, majority voting for directors, the corporate governance reform movement, and shareholder litigation, touching on both securities fraud class actions and deal litigation.  We will examine the debate over socially responsible investing and the problems posed by corporations' use of shareholder dollars to make campaign contributions, particularly in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in Citizens United.  In examining these debates we will discuss the costs and benefits of such activism.  Students will also develop an appreciation for the institutional players that drive this activism, and for those that oppose it.  PREREQUISITE: Corporations (may be waived with instructor's permission).  NOTE: A limited number of students may be permitted to satisfy the upper-class writing requirement with the approval of the instructor. GRADING NOTICE: This course does not offer the CR/NC/H option. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.

LAW JD 931: Private Equity and Venture Capital Transactions (S)
	This seminar introduces students to the business and legal issues prevalent in private equity and venture capital deals and highlights the significant role that lawyers play in effecting these transactions.  The seminar will begin with an overview of the private equity and venture capital industries, an introduction to investment transactions and will proceed through all aspects of the life of an investment from inception to exit.  It will address how investment funds are formed and the legal and financial considerations present when those funds invest in private companies.  We will examine deal terms and structures, pricing and corporate finance issues, and the management of deal risk.  It will also highlight the due diligence process, stockholder relationships, fiduciary duties and securities laws considerations, and liquidity events.  Theoretical readings will be balanced against practical articles and commentary, recent court decisions and model deal documents.

LAW JD 932: Admiralty
	Admiralty cases comprise a significant portion of the case load of federal courts near U.S. ports.  Clerks for judges in those courts should have an understanding of admiralty law.  In addition, lawyers who handle international transactions will likely encounter admiralty issues even if they do not specialize in admiralty law.  The practice of admiralty law is by its nature international.  Admiralty practitioners work with lawyers and clients from many nations and travel often to those nations.  The course will examine admiralty jurisdiction of the federal and state courts as well as oft litigated choice of law and choice of forum issues.  Our examination of the substantive areas of admiralty law will show how they fit together and affect one another.  The substantive areas will include the international and domestic multimodal carriage of goods, charter parties (contracts to use an entire ship or part of a ship), salvage, towing, pilotage, collision, stranding, general average, and personal injury.  We shall also examine ship mortgages and marine insurance.  Marine insurance affects almost all aspects of admiralty law.  We shall attempt to predict the affects of the Rotterdam Rules (a new treaty that the United States and other nations are in the process of ratifying) on various aspects of admiralty law, particularly the carriage of goods. This course is a pre-requisite to apply for membership in the three student Judge John R. Brown Admiralty Moot Court Competition, which will be held in Charleston, S.C. from March 19 to 21, 2015. Applicants must also participate before March 19, 2015 in the Stone Moot Court Competition. OFFERING PATTERN: This class is not offered every year.  Students are advised to take this into account when planning their long-term schedule.		

LAW JD 933: Anarchism (S)
	Anarchism is usually by treated political philosophers as either a starting point for statist theories (Nozick) or as a reductio in arguments against opposing theories ("But that's anarchy!"), but very little attempt is made to consider it as a plausible alternative to statist theories.  In this course we will discuss the varieties of anarchisms and a range of issues connected to it:  the obligation to obey the law, the nature of political consent, the nature of justification and legitimacy.  We will also discuss historical examples of anarchism and a wide range of theorists past and present from Bakunin and Goldmann to Simmons and Huemer. Written work will consist of two papers, 2500-3500 words each, one due around mid-term, the other due at the end of the term.  Each will address a theoretical issue directly related to one or more of the issues that will have already been addressed in the seminar.  One of each student's papers will be read by one of the instructors, the other one will be read by the other instructor. The seminar will be open to both upper-class law students and graduate students in philosophy.  The seminar will meet in STH 541 on Thursdays 4:20-6:20 pm but will follow the Law School's calendar, meeting from January 15 through April 16.   ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar, or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, will be administratively dropped from the seminar. Students who wait list for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment.   		

LAW JD 934: Affordable Housing Law Externship: Fieldwork (C)
	Through the Affordable Housing Externship Program, students receive credit for an externship done in conjunction with the Affordable Housing and Community Development seminar (JD935), taught by Mr. Peter Freeman.  Students receive 3 credits (C/NC) for performing 150 hours of fieldwork (about 12 hours per week), and 3 credits (graded) for the weekly seminar.  The solutions to the ongoing problem and challenge of providing affordable housing and sustainable community development in our nation's cities and towns will occur only through the interdisciplinary efforts of lawyers, community groups, financial institutions, architects, engineers, planners and governmental agencies (at the local, state and federal levels). The Affordable Housing Externship Program provides opportunities for students to interface directly with the players mentioned above. "Learning the law" in this field is therefore enhanced immeasurably.  The externship component offers the opportunity for students to experience how various laws, tools and programs come together in the real world to achieve the goal - project by project and case by case - of providing affordable housing and sustainable community development. Boston has a great wealth of public and non-profit housing and community development agencies, each providing a great experience for students. Students must submit an application for the Externship by April 15.  Please contact Mr. Freeman for more information about specific placement possibilities.		

LAW JD 935: Affordable Housing Law (S)
	The seminar will combine a focus on: 1) public policy issues related to the goals of creation of affordable housing in the context of community revitalization; and 2) real-world implementation strategies that have been successfully used to achieve these goals.  Analyzing the roles of government agencies, non-profit organizations, neighborhood groups, and private businesses will be a key part of the seminar.  In lieu of a traditional exam or term paper, students will engage in field research and investigation of real community projects as part of semester long case studies, where they will work with lawyers, government officials, developers and grass-roots advocates involved with the projects.  The relative utility of traditional legal techniques (such as land use planning devices,  zoning, easements, revolving trusts, leasehold covenants and financing) will be carefully analyzed; the policies and impact of federal, state and local laws, including federal and state affordable housing financing programs and the Community Preservation Act in Massachusetts, will be examined; and possible new approaches will be considered.  By incorporating real-world projects into the seminar, it is hoped that the interface of law, economics, planning, design, and construction disciplines will enable the problems to be analyzed from a variety of perspectives reflecting a client's and a community's practical concerns.  LIMITED WRITING REQUIREMENT OPTION:  A limited number of students may be permitted to satisfy the upper-class writing requirement with the approval of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. CLINIC OPTION: A limited number of students may apply to enroll in the Affordable Housing Law Externship Program (JD934).

LAW JD 936: International Development and Project Finance (S)
	Capital-intensive public and private development projects throughout the world, including large-scale infrastructure, transportation, energy, agriculture, technology and environmental projects depend upon project financing as the primary funding mechanism.  Understanding and resolving the political, legal and financial risks associated with the planning and implementation of these projects, and often in emerging and unstable economies, is the critical first step in developing project finance opportunities.  The seminar will combine theory and practice and focus on the negotiation and structure of actual project finance and concession agreements and transactions and the minimization of exposures and risks associated with these transactions.  Each step of the project finance process will be analyzed, including the rationale and sources for the project finance, the legal framework for the project finance, the organizational and governance structure, risk allocation and mitigation and dispute resolution.  An interdisciplinary analysis from the legal, finance and public perspective will be used to assess the views that investors, lenders, designers, contractors, governmental participants, citizens and other stakeholders bring to an infrastructure project.  Several of the world's largest and most complex civil engineering and infrastructure mega projects including the English Chunnel, the Chad Cameroon Pipeline, the Dabhol Power Project and Boston's Central Artery Tunnel Project will serve as models for analysis of project finance and risk.  A final research paper will be required in lieu of an examination.  NOTE: This seminar satisfies the Upper-class Professional Skills requirement.  LIMITED WRITING REQUIREMENT OPTION: A limited number of students may be permitted to satisfy the upper-class writing requirement.  **A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.

LAW JD 941: Corporate Governance (S)
	This seminar will address corporate governance issues from an historical as well as current perspective.  In addressing the legal framework of corporate governance for the modern U.S. corporation, we will consider the implications for corporate governance posed by different players, including investors, independent directors, corporate management, employees and other stakeholders.  Throughout our discussions, we will seek to take into account the roles played by courts, legislatures, and regulatory bodies, as well as the challenges and responsibilities of lawyers who advise their clients in various settings.  In addition to discussion of legal academic writings, cases and relevant laws, we will engage in a number of role-playing exercises in class.  For example, students may be called upon to play various roles in a simulated annual meeting of shareholders involving a campaign to withhold votes to elect a company's board chairman or to play the role of legal advisers to independent directors of a company's board who are called upon to negotiate the compensation of the company's chief executive officer.  There is no exam in this course.  Each student will be required to write one short paper (up to 5 pages) that will cover a topic for a given class and will be responsible for leading (or co-leading with one or more other students) the discussion on that topic for a substantial portion of that class.  In this regard, the student or students responsible for leading the discussion in a given class will also be asked to identify and post an additional reading for that class.  Each student will also be required to write a longer paper of publishable quality due at the end of the semester.  The professor will consult with each student at the outset, when a research topic is chosen, and during other stages of the research and writing process.  PREREQUISITE: Corporations.

	Examines the basic principles of substantive criminal law, including the justifications for punishment, the essential elements of offenses, mitigating and exculpating defenses, and different forms of criminal liability.		

LAW JD 948: Immigrants &amp; the Law (S)
	 Recent census data informs us that there are approximately 40 million immigrants living in the United States.  About 11 million of these immigrants are undocumented or otherwise in the country illegally.  The rest of the country remains divided on their feelings regarding the immigrant population, with about half believing that immigrants "strengthen the country because of their hard work and talent, while 41% [believe them to be] a burden because they take jobs, health care and housing."  1 This course will investigate the life of an immigrant in American society from a legal perspective.  Students will learn how immigrants, both documented and undocumented, interact with various sections of the American system.  The goal is to assess various ways in which an individual's immigration status affects access to important rights and benefits accorded to citizens and analyze the legal rationale for existing limitations.  We will examine these issues through the use of law review articles, court cases, existing and proposed legislation, newspaper articles, empirical studies, and governmental and private organizational position papers. Topics may include an investigation of an immigrant's access and limitations in primary and secondary education, public benefits, the court system, employment, voting, as well as modes of immigration policing by both federal immigration authorities and state police. LIMITED WRITING REQUIREMENT OPTION: A limited number of students may be permitted to satisfy the upper-class writing requirement.  GRADING NOTICE: This course does not offer the CR/NC/H option. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.

	This seminar will focus upon the substantive law of homicide, as well as the practical aspects of actual homicide investigations and trials:  crime scene interpretation; DNA analysis; autopsies and related forensic evidence; expert testimony, particularly in the area of psychiatry and criminal responsibility; jury considerations; ethical concerns; and the role of the media. Students will have the opportunity to study actual murder cases, visit local crime laboratories and courtrooms, and learn prosecution, defense, and judicial perspectives on various contemporary issues arising in murder investigations and trials.  NOTE:  This seminar satisfies the Upper-class Professional Skills requirement.  LIMITED WRITING REQUIREMENT OPTION:  A limited number of students may be permitted to satisfy the upper-class writing requirement with the approval of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.  OFFERING PATTERN: This class is not offered every year.

Students who waitlist for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment.   		

LAW JD 951: Comparative Law (S)
	This seminar is an introduction to comparative law's themes and methods.  Accordingly, the seminar is organized in two parts.  The readings selected for the first part present theoretical articulations and practical applications of the main methodological approaches relied upon by comparative lawyers.  Participants will become acquainted with the "mechanics", as well as the broader implications, of the various ways of comparing: functionalism, structuralism, culturalism, postmodern neo-culturalism and critical comparative law.  The materials discussed in the second part explore how these different methodologies play out in recent and heated comparative law debates. Participants will be asked to reflect over the common law-civil law dichotomy and its implications for the debate over the European Civil Code as well as for projects of harmonization, such as the World Bank's "Legal Origins" study; the circulation of legal rules and institutions and the export of constitutional models in Eastern Europe and Iraq; the ambiguous relation between US and European legal cultures and the debate over different ideas of "privacy"; the "West" and the "Orient" in family law reform. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.  Students who are on a wait list for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment.		

LAW JD 952: Copyright Law
	Copyright is one of the major legal regimes governing art, software, information, and entertainment, and its rules deeply affect how the internet operates. This course is a policy and skills-oriented study of federal copyright law.    Much of copyright policy can be clarified by using some basic tools from economics and philosophy; these analytic tools will be taught during the course, and no prior knowledge is required. As for skills, the course focuses on two: how to tackle and master a complex set of interrelated statutory provisions, and how to articulate legal principles orally in a way that would be comprehensible to an untutored judge.  Rather than having a predominant lecture format, the course puts student analysis at its center.  The course will cover the exclusive rights granted to creators of "original works of authorship", the authorial subject-matters eligible for federal copyright, the nature of an infringement action, and defenses such as fair use. In addition, students will be expected to master at least one detailed, statute-governed topic such as duration (how long do rights over a given work of authorship remain in private hands before becoming free for all to copy) or the inalienable right of termination (how authors can retrieve their copyrights despite having signed contracts indicating that they have sold all rights).  The course also examines some state rights, such as the 'right of publicity' and 'quasi-property rights against the misappropriation of data', for purposes of exploring how these state doctrines interact with, or are pre-empted by, federal copyright law.		

LAW JD 953: International Intellectual Property (S)
		International law is increasingly important to domestic lawyers every day. This is as true in intellectual property as in any field. Regulation of intellectual property is a cornerstone in the globalization of trade and commerce. In order to harmonize intellectual property laws, more and more countries sign up to multilateral agreements regulating these laws. However, jurisdictional differences still exist and affect this process. This seminar examines international agreements and comparative laws on intellectual property and ways in which the intellectual property laws of the United States relate to those of other nations. Topics will include securing and enforcing rights in trademarks, copyrights and patents under international regimes and in various jurisdictions, and selected topics such as database protection, geographical indications, the interplay between intellectual property, international trade and culture, and Internet-related issues.   The seminar is designed to afford students who intend to practice in IP an acquaintance with key international IP principles and policy issues. The seminar will impart understanding in these areas using materials such as treaties, cases and commentary. The seminar will treat international and European intellectual property separately, and will focus on the major international systems related to each substantive IP area. The seminar is open to students who have completed or are enrolled in an IP survey course, or to LLMs with some intellectual property experience.  LIMITED WRITING REQUIREMENT OPTION:  A limited number of students may be permitted to satisfy the upper-class writing requirement with the approval of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 16 students. GRADING NOTICE: This course does not offer the CR/NC/H option. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar, or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, will be administratively dropped from the seminar.

LAW JD 957: Law and Sexual Minorities (S)
	This seminar will consider the legal treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered citizens.  In particular, the seminar will cover evolving family structures, privacy rights, the military, employment discrimination, and the tension between protecting the rights of victims of discrimination and those who discriminate.  Students will write a research paper or an appellate brief and will prepare an oral presentation.  Students may satisfy the upperclass writing requirement with their paper. OFFERING PATTERN: This class is not offered every year.  Students are advised to take this into account when planning their long-term schedule. ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 18 students. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar, or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, will be administratively dropped from the seminar. Students who wait list for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment.   		

LAW JD 958: Effective &amp; Ethical Depositions (S)
	The purpose of this seminar is to teach students how to take and defend effective and ethical depositions.  The course involves both a simulated deposition component and a professional responsibility component.  The seminar also satisfies the professional responsibility requirement.  Simulated Deposition Course Component:  Students will be divided into firms representing either the Plaintiff or the Defendants in a gender discrimination and defamation case brought by an attorney who has been denied partnership.  The students will prepare and perform depositions of lay and expert witnesses and gather experience with obtaining and developing facts, preserving testimony, and the uses of depositions.  Professional Responsibility Course Component:  The simulated context offers the opportunity to explore several professional responsibility issues that arise naturally in deposition practice.  These issues emerge largely because of the dual professional roles of an attorney:  zealous representative and officer of the court.  Some of the more timely issues involve proper witness preparation, improper witness coaching, inadvertent waiver of privilege, and abusive tactics.  Writing and Performance Requirements:  Each week students will write a short one or two page comment on the professional responsibility issues raised in class.  At the end of the course, students will perform a videotaped deposition rather than take a final written exam.  NOTE:  This seminar satisfies the Upper-class Professional Skills requirement. ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 16 students. LIMITED WRITING REQUIREMENT: A limited number of students may elect to use this course to fulfill the upper-class writing requirement.  GRADING NOTICE:  This seminar does not offer the CR/NC/H option. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar, or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, will be administratively dropped from the seminar.

LAW JD 959: International Business Agreements: Negotiating, Structuring and Drafting (S)
	This seminar will provide an overview of the private dimensions of negotiating and drafting international business agreements, and specifically on the contractual aspects. Students will gain hands on experience in structuring, drafting and analyzing various international business agreements and documents including global joint venture agreements and privatization provisions, sales, distribution and franchise agreements, international development agreements, share purchase agreements, letters of intent and technology licensing agreements.   The design of the class will assist students in identifying critical legal issues and techniques likely to affect the outcome of international business negotiations including protecting against political, economic and legal risks. Emphasis will be placed on the important differences between international and domestic agreements from the American law perspective. Grades will be based on class participation and a final research paper.  At the option of the student a final examination can be taken in lieu of a research paper.  NOTE:  This seminar satisfies the Upper-class Professional Skills requirement.  LIMITED WRITING REQUIREMENT OPTION:  A limited number of students may be permitted to satisfy the upper-class writing requirement. **A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.  Students who are on a wait list for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment.  		

LAW JD 962: Forensic Mental Health Issues for Lawyers (S)
	Attorneys routinely deal with forensic mental health issues in the practice of criminal, tort, juvenile delinquency, child protection, civil rights, disability, employment and family law.  Familiarity with the law alone is rarely adequate for effective advocacy in these areas of law when mental health issues arise.  This course surveys the intersection between psychiatry and law with a focus on applications for legal practice.  Topics include:  competence to stand trial, criminal responsibility, competence to be executed, involuntary civil commitment, child protection and divorce child custody, commitment of sexual offenders, mental health malpractice, emotional distress claims, and use of mental health expert testimony in the post-Daubert era.  NOTES: This seminar does not satisfy the Upper-class Writing Requirement. OFFERING PATTERN: This class is not offered every year.  Students are advised to take this into account when planning their long-term schedule. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar. Students who are on a wait list for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment. 		

LAW JD 964: Patent Litigation
	This course will examine all aspects of U.S. patent litigation, beginning with pre-filing considerations such as standing, jurisdiction, and choice of law, and ending with the appeal.  Particular attention will be given to pleadings, claim construction, discovery, and motion practice, as well as the methods of proving invalidity, unenforceability, and infringement.  The course will also consider trial preparation techniques, trial practice, the role of technical experts, and the remedies available in patent cases.  Students will be evaluated based on a writing assignment that will require drafting a litigation-related document, such as a claim construction brief or summary judgment motion, and a short final exam.  No scientific or technical background is required to enroll in this course, and there are no prerequisites, although prior or concurrent exposure to patent law (such as through the Patent Law course or the Intellectual Property course) may be helpful.    		

LAW JD 967: Advanced Trial Practice (S)
	This intensive seminar takes an integrated approach to civil and criminal procedure, evidence, and trial practice to teach the current trial techniques at work in our courts.  Taught at the United States District Court itself, the course involves in-court observations, specific critique of actual trial presentations, and seminar discussion of all aspects of procedure, trial preparation, evidence, and trial practice.  A term paper on some aspect of the trial process is required.  While neither evidence nor trial practice is a formal prerequisite for this course, they are recommended.  The goal of the seminar is to enhance the quality of judgment, exposition, and fact-law teaching a lawyer exercises on behalf of the client in the trial environment.  The first class meeting will take place at the Law School - Date/Time TBA.  LIMITED WRITING REQUIREMENT OPTION:  A limited number of students may be permitted to satisfy the upper-class writing requirement with the approval of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.

The topics covered by this course include the power of the Congress to regulate immigration; the effect of politics on immigration policy; nonimmigrant and immigrant visa classifications and visa processing; the law of asylum; the effect of criminal acts on immigration status; grounds of removal from the United States; relief from deportation, immigration court representation; and the law of naturalization and derived citizenship.  GRADING NOTICE: This course does not offer the CR/NC/H option.		

LAW JD 970: Representing Clients in Civil Actions (S)
	 A family and a business struggle with a real death and a real lawsuit.  The case is yours.  Now what?  In this seminar, students will represent opposing parties in a civil action based upon real events involving the death of a college student while on spring break in Mexico.  Through discussion, role plays, simulations and out-of-class assignments, students will gain perspective on what's at stake when handling a serious and complex matter in the real world - from the first client meeting to settlement.  The goal of the class is for students to learn the skills they need to be effective counsel in civil actions, including fact gathering, interviewing clients and witnesses, drafting a complaint, preparing interrogatories and responses, conducting depositions, evaluating the strength of a case, and preparing a settlement memoranda.  Beyond developing important technical skills, students will develop their abilities to communicate effectively, evaluate options, make decisions, assess risk, exercise judgment, and counsel wisely - the real skills they will use every day as lawyers.  Students will be evaluated based on class participation and written work.  NOTE:  This class satisfies the Upper-class Professional Skills requirement. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.

LAW JD 972: Lawyering in the 21st Century (S)
	The practice of law has changed dramatically in the last several decades and is expected to change even more in the not-too-distant future.  Developments in global commerce and information technology are at the forefront of this change.  The globalization of commerce has resulted in the globalization of law practice, making the regulation of lawyers more difficult and less predictable.  Changes in lawyer regulation elsewhere in the world, such as the radical reforms recently enacted in the UK and in Australia (permitting the ownership of law firms by nonlawyers, including public investment, as well as the formation of multidisciplinary practices), are bound to have important implications for US lawyers.  Even for lawyers whose practices remain primarily local, developments in information technology have resulted in new challenges, such as: 1) storing and protecting the confidentiality of electronic files; 2) regulating the quality of work outsourced to cheaper providers, including foreign lawyers; 3) regulating the provision of legal services through the internet; and 4) special issues concerning marketing and confidentiality that arise from the extensive use of social network sites.  This seminar will explore the ethical issues raised by these changes in the practice of law, including issues concerning unauthorized practice of law, conflicts of interest, confidentiality, advertising and solicitation. A substantial research paper will be required. There are no prerequisites for this seminar. This seminar satisfies the upper-class professional responsibility requirement. ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 18 students. GRADING NOTICE:  This seminar does not offer the CR/NC/H option.  ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.

LAW JD 977: Health Care Reform &amp; the Constitution (S)
	This seminar will examine the complex web of federal and state regulations that form the center of American healthcare policy and American healthcare reform, including but not limited to the Obamacare statute's new laws and regulations. The goal for the semester will be to determine the best balance of federal and state governance and the best balance of legislative, executive, and judicial governance for healthcare policy. The first half of the course will center on the considerations that guide constitutional divisions of labor between our national and state governments (uniformity interests, political diversity, state experimentation, interstate competition, and regulatory success (among others)), and the second half of the course will center the considerations that guide constitutional divisions of labor among the three branches of the federal government (expertise, political accountability, agency capture, and individual justice (among others)). We will also discuss the role that private markets can, do, and should play in distributing scarce healthcare resources. Specific topics will include the Obamacare individual mandate and Medicaid expansion, public healthcare financing, private insurance regulation, healthcare quality controls, healthcare privacy rules, and bioethical questions like reproductive rights and the right to die.  ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 18 students.

LAW JD 990: Feminist Jurisprudence (S)
	This seminar examines the evolution of feminist legal theory and its critique of the U.S. legal system and its norms.  It takes up various debates within feminist jurisprudence and examines its application to many contemporary issues of law and public policy.  The seminar provides an introduction to feminist jurisprudence and the various "generations" of such scholarship, as well as its relationship to other forms of legal theory.  Students will learn about several prominent strands of feminist legal theory, including liberal (or sameness), relational (or difference), radical (or dominance), Critical Race and anti-essentialist, postmodern, and "Third Wave."  We will consider the relationship between feminist jurisprudence and other forms of critical theory, such as Critical Race Theory, Queer Theory, and masculinities theory.  The seminar will assess debates within feminist jurisprudence concerning how best to understand gender, the ideals of sex equality and equal citizenship, questions of sameness and difference between women and men, and over whether, in view of differences among women based on class, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation and the like, it is desirable or possible to speak about "women" - or "men" - as a meaningful category.  Topics covered vary, but will likely include some of the following: legal regulation of sexuality, marriage, reproduction, and family; work/life conflict; employment discrimination (including sexual harassment); political leadership and representation; pornography; poverty and social welfare policy; violence against women; war and military service; international human rights; and the debate over multiculturalism and its impact on sex equality.  The format of the seminar is primarily discussion, with some lecturing. The written requirement may be satisfied either by a research paper (which may be used to satisfy the certification requirement) or three shorter papers on assigned questions (which may also be used to satisfy the certification requirement) or a take-home exam.  Students will also write several short reaction papers about the readings. OFFERING PATTERN: This class not offered every year.

LAW JD 991: International Human Rights (S)
	This is an introductory course to international human rights. The course will introduce students to the concepts of human rights, and the instruments that have codified and provided content to those concepts in the last sixty years. We will examine such questions as: Is there such a thing as human rights law? What standards, mechanisms, monitoring or enforcement machinery exists to make human rights concepts "legal"? Is there such a thing as universal consensus on human rights, or are the concepts relative from one region to the next? What, if any, constraints does human rights law place on the actions of sovereign states? How does the UN machinery operate in human rights law-making, monitoring and enforcement? What is the role of regional organizations, domestic courts and international entities in developing, promoting and implementing human rights norms? The course will take a contextualized approach using cases and current situations to address these questions primarily from a human rights perspective.  LIMITED WRITING REQUIREMENT OPTION: A limited number of students may be permitted to satisfy the upper-class writing requirement. GRADING NOTICE: This course does not offer the CR/NC/H option. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar, or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, will be administratively dropped from the seminar.

We will focus on the powers of the respective players in each of these fields, including local and state government, the federal government and tribal governments.  OFFERING PATTERN: This class is not offered every year.  Students are advised to take this into account when planning their long-term schedule.		

LAW JD 998: Health Care Transactions (S)
	This course is centered in the health care sector.  Partners, associates and general counsel from leading firms will discuss the deals they were personally involved in.  After an introduction to joint venture theory and the regulatory context of health care, everyone in the class examines 2 transactions: a physician recruiting agreement and an ambulatory surgery center JV.  The remainder of the course will involve 5 - 6 complex health care transactions, using actual documents from recent deals.  The transactions run the gamut from hospital M&amp;A to biotech licenses.  For the transaction you select, you will work in teams to analyze the deal, and will present your conclusions to the lawyers who closed it.  Your final project will be a negotiation or drafting assignment drawn from class materials.  The course is taught by Dan Roble (partner emeritus, Ropes &amp; Gray, Boston) and Jeff Heidt (partner at Verrill Dana, Boston), based on the course created by Professor Outterson.

LAW TX 950: Tax Aspects of Charitable Giving
	Charitable gift planning has long been a crucial component in wealth management and estate planning.  It remains an important factor in the "tool box" of estate and tax professionals.

LAW TX 955: Taxation of Intellectual Property
	Intellectual property- from sophisticated aerospace technology to computer software and web applications to music and video rights- is one of the most important, challenging, and sophisticated areas of modern commerce. However, because the IP revolution has occurred in only the last 25 years, many of the traditional principles of income taxation are not easily applied to IP assets. This course will explore the tax aspects of creating intellectual property, buying intellectual property, exploiting IP through leases and licenses, and strategies for selling valuable IP rights with the best tax results. The course will also explore important international tax issues, including the so called "migration" of IP offshore, cost-sharing arrangements, and other mechanisms that seek to "locate" IP and the associated tax liabilities in tax-favorable jurisdictions. The course will teach the tax differences between copyrighting and patenting a software program, the right and wrong ways to license and sell a trademark, and the mechanisms for turning a "license" into a "sale" and thereby converting ordinary income into capitol gains. 		

LAW TX 958: International Estate Planning

Planning techniques and vehicles utilized in international estate planning will be explored, in particular trusts and the special U.S. income tax rules applicable to foreign trusts with U.S. beneficiaries and off-shore U.S.-grantor trusts. The impact of non-U.S. transfer taxes and tax treaties will be considered, as well as non-tax foreign laws impacting on international estate planning. The course will also cover the U.S. tax and estate planning issues applicable to "mixed marriages" where one spouse is a U.S. citizen and the other is a non-U.S. citizen, and multi-jurisdiction situations of gifts or bequests from non-U.S. donors or decedents to U.S. beneficiaries. Finally, the course will also consider cultural and ethical issues peculiar to the area of international estate planning.  Prerequisite or corequisite: Estate and Gift Tax, Estate Planning  		

LAW TX 959: Making Tax Law
	The course explores how U.S. tax law is made in order to provide context and perspective for interpreting the various provisions of the tax law.  It examines how considerations of tax policy, tax politics and tax administration contribute to the development of law through the legislative process, the promulgation of regulations and other administrative guidance, and the negotiation and ratification of tax treaties, as well as interactions and judicial evaluations of all of the above.  In other words, the course explores what happens on the road to tax law and what causes those twists and turns.  It necessarily discusses issues of tax policy, but the principal focus is on process.  We will use traditional cases, legislative documents, and other materials.  Pre or corequisite: None

LAW TX 968: Tax and Technology
	This course examines the convergence of technology solutions, in support of taxation, from two different angles: corporations and government. On one hand, corporations use technology applied to the many areas of tax, to increase efficiencies and reduce error rates caused by manual processes. In doing so, they reduce risk, audit exposure and potential bad publicity, as they want to display good corporate citizenship. On the other hand, governments in general and tax authorities in particular are using IT (Information Technology) structures and relational databases quite widely to set up processes and procedures to encourage compliance, including taxpayer assistance; as well as data processing, audit selection, enforcement and fraud detection. The course will also compare and contrast these movements in America with other countries, as US-headquartered companies expanding abroad face new realities, unfamiliar tax structures and increasingly complex regulatory environments; and legal and tax professionals must be prepared for these challenges. Rather than focus on technology per se, analyzing computer programming language and codes, the bias of this course is the real-life business perspective of technology when applied to taxation and fiscal policy.

The course materials will consist of traditional statutory and case materials, explanatory materials, and legal documents, such as letters of intent, confidentiality agreements, merger agreements, etc. The course will use U.S. materials (particularly the law of Delaware) as base materials, but will also consider trans-border transactions.		

LAW XB 819: International Arbitration
	The old maxim "where business goes, disputes soon follow" has renewed vitality in an age of globalization.  As cross-border commerce follows American business abroad, and offshore foreign investment flows into the U.S., the potential for clashes in the business expectations of the parties increases, particularly as the economy softens.  Dispute resolution thus becomes an almost inescapable component of today's private international commercial dispute process.  The focus of the course will be on international arbitration, from inception in the contractual drafting through the mechanics of the dispute resolution process to the enforcement stage, with some consideration of other alternative dispute resolution techniques.  The original case studies and related materials are largely drawn from actual practice.  This course is designed for corporate attorneys as well as litigators. 		

LAW XB 820: Corporate Finance with U.S. and International Reporting
	Corporate Finance and Accounting is concerned with understanding financial statements and reports. The objective is that students will be able to read and understand the four financial statements and the 10-k annual report. Emphasis is placed on understanding the nature and meaning of the reports, as well as the relationship to the underlying transactions. Other topics may include: basic accounting principles, US GAAP versus IFRS, financial statement analysis, the relationship of the financial statement information to covenant documents, and accounting gamesmanship. It will also include analysis and structuring of capital transactions, with emphasis on financial statement analysis, attributes of equity and debt securities and transactions which restructure existing corporate capitalizations. Transactions discussed will include an acquisition, an out-of-court debt restructuring and a negotiated reallocation of equity.		

LAW XB 821: Current Issues in U.S. Business Law Colloquium
	During the two-week residential periods of each session, our students participate in a luncheon workshop series focusing on a wide range of issues related to U.S. business law. Our guest speakers are prominent practitioners, experts and academics who provide an engaging and enriching pedagogical and networking experience for our students. A select number of spots are typically opened to LL.M. students in Boston University's American Law, Graduate Tax, or Banking Law programs.		

LAW XB 822: Managing Compliance Risks for International Business Networks
	Extraterritorial application of US laws -- particularly in the areas of anti-corruption and sanctions -- has exposed multinational businesses and their networks of foreign subsidiaries, agents and collaborators to heightened risk of civil and criminal liability. High-profile prosecutions and fines have underscored the potential cost of non-compliance and the need for enhanced due diligence and monitoring of international business relationships. This course examines recent developments in US law that impact compliance risks in international business operations, and explores potential tools for evaluating and managing those risks.		

LAW XB 823: Deals: The Legal Engineering Behind Corporate Transactions
	This course looks at how lawyers can, and do, add value to complex transactions and contracts, or deals. The course will identify and evaluate common issues that present contractual risks for corporate clients and examine how those risks can be resolved or mitigated by legal advisers, whether through structural or contractual mechanisms. Students will be introduced to a conceptual framework with which to analyze legal risks in business transactions including informational asymmetry, adverse selection, moral hazard, asset specificity and opportunism and contractual incentives. During the residency period students will be given the opportunity to apply those concepts during moderated negotiations of scenarios taken from real world transactions, and then will examine and evaluate the final contractual documentation from those transactions.		

LAW XB 951: U.S. Transfer Pricing
	This course undertakes a detailed examination of the US transfer pricing rules, policies and procedures. It will only casually address issues in other jurisdictions -- transfer pricing rules in strongly OECD jurisdictions like Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia will be considered only in a contrasting manner to provide context. In addition, the transfer pricing rules in customs and those in the VAT (EU and elsewhere) will similarly be considered only where they provide contrast to the US rules.		

LAW XB 961: Federal Income Tax
	This course presents an introduction to the fundamentals of federal income tax law, emphasizing issues common to individual taxpayers. Topics include an overview of the federal tax system; gross income, inclusions and exclusions; identity of the proper taxpayer; concepts and categories of deductions; basic timing principles; federal income tax aspects of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of property; realization and recognition; basis and amount realized; the effects of debt (including its cancellation); depreciation and amortization; at risk, not for profit, and passive activity loss deductibility limitations; capital gains and losses, related party transactions, quasi-capital assets and depreciation recapture; and deferred payment transactions (original issue discount and installment sales).		

LAW XB 962: Intl. Tax
			

LAW XB 970: Environmental Law
	This course takes a hybrid approach to teaching environmental law. This course will: (1) provide an overview of some of the major environmental statutes in the United States; (2) address the variety of regulatory tools and concepts that can be used to prevent environmental harm, focusing on the proper match between regulatory tool and environmental harm; and (3) discuss the role of other disciplines (e.g., science) and alternative means (e.g., public awareness) to facilitate changes in environmental policy.		

LAW XB 971: Administrative Law  Administrative Law
	The goal of Administrative Law is to provide students with a working knowledge of the general principles of administrative law, a general knowledge of the workings of bureaucratic institutions, and an understanding of the critiques of government. It examines the implementation of legislative policy through administrative agencies, including the role of administrative agencies in the governmental process, rulemaking, adjudication, and judicial review of agency actions. The goal of this particular course is to provide a general introduction to administrative law and then emphasize how to advocate your position to government agencies using those principles.		

LAW XB 972: Energy Law and Policy in a Carbon-Constrained World
	The energy industry is both a key to the life that billions seek and our world's most significant source of pollution. Environmental problems are the most important constraint now faced by energy industries. This course examines the key issues in American energy policy (with references to global context), and searches for ways to resolve, or at least ease, the strains that that policy puts upon environmental sustainability.(pre-requisite for Energy Regulation and the Environment)		

LAW XB 973: Energy Regulation and the Environment
	Energy is the fundamental necessity of civilization and, indeed, of life itself. And, yet, we cannot repeal the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which teaches that in a closed system such as Planet Earth, the use of energy will gradually transform everything of value into a state of useless entropy. Fortunately, as global climate change acquaints us viscerally with this ineluctable reality and its grim implications, we have a legal and regulatory framework that can be pressed into service to address the entropy challenge without unnecessarily sacrificing public safety and welfare. This intermediate level course is intended to provide students with an intimate familiarity with that legal and regulatory framework. (pre-requisite: Energy Law &amp; Policy in a Carbon-Constrained World)  		

LAW XB 974: Alternative Fuels and Renewable Energy
	This survey course is built on the three major cornerstones of renewable energy development: technology, socioeconomics, and law and policy. It targets a diverse audience including aspiring and experienced energy and environmental professionals, public policy analysts, and attorneys venturing into the world of renewable energy. The course utilizes an interdisciplinary approach featuring learning materials from law, economics, sociology, environmental science, and engineering.		

LAW XB 975: Oil and Gas Development and the Environment
	Navigating the complex labyrinth of contemporary energy and environmental issues requires a firm understanding of legal and policy concepts of oil and gas development. This course examines the legal and regulatory framework of domestic and international upstream and downstream oil and gas activities. The course explores key domestic statutory and common law sources, as well as regulations. It also surveys selected international and comparative materials such as joint field development agreements and arbitral decisions. The course maintains an environmental perspective and examines several important case studies such as the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, hydraulic fracturing (fracking) activities in the Marcellus Shale, and Arctic offshore hydrocarbon development.		

LAW XB 976: Environmental Dispute Resolution
	This course explores the range of processes that are used to resolve environmental disputes with particular emphasis on consensual processes such as negotiation and mediation. Instruction will be based on readings, simulations, discussions and exercises of the theory of dispute resolution and environmental law. One aim of this course is to help students build the skills necessary to be effective negotiators and advocates in the environmental context.
