			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/law/courses/law-jd-720/"><strong>LAW JD 720: Remedies</strong></a><br>
			            			The course explores the principal remedies available through civil litigation, including compensatory damages, injunctions, declaratory judgments, restitution, and punitive damages, along with remedial defenses. It covers both private-law and public-law remedies. The course examines general principles about the law of remedies that cut across substantive fields and that will be useful to a student or lawyer encountering a remedies problem in any context. It also takes up debates concerning whether law and economics or corrective justice provides a better account of the aims and underlying principles of the law of remedies. The course will be of considerable practical value to anyone interested in civil litigation.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/law/courses/law-jd-721/"><strong>LAW JD 721: Advanced Topics in Civil Procedure - Court Access</strong></a><br>
			            			This seminar will examine the political, institutional, and constitutional constraints and forces that shape the rules governing litigation in the federal courts. Particular attention will be given to ways that access to the federal courts has been narrowed in the last three decades using procedural rules. Readings will focus on selected topics of federal civil procedure, including class actions, attorneys' fees, injunctive remedies, and full-faith and credit.  Students will have two options for satisfying the writing requirement: they may write (1) a seminar paper, or (2) three medium-length policy or response papers. Students will also be required to present their written work. To that end we will dedicate several sessions to student presentations of papers or works-in-progress.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/law/courses/law-jd-722/"><strong>LAW JD 722: Environmental Justice Law</strong></a><br>
			            			  Environmental Justice can be defined as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws and policies.  Over the last two decades efforts to secure environmental justice have become important features of environmental policy and activism.  This course will explore why environmental justice concerns have arisen, and what legal mechanisms may be used to address them.  We will identify current situations where claims of environmental injustice might be made, and examine how existing legal tools, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act and federal environmental statutes, might be applied to deal with them.  The final grade will be determined by grades received on two short papers (each maximum 1,200 words; each 25% of the final grade); a final take-home exam (maximum 1,200 words; 40%); and class participation (10%), based on the quality, not quantity, of the contributions made. OFFERING PATTERN: This class not offered every year.  Students are advised to take this into account when planning their long-term schedule.		</li><li class="dontsplit">
			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/law/courses/law-jd-726/"><strong>LAW JD 726: Health Care Fraud and Abuse (S)</strong></a><br>
			            			This seminar will use a practical, case-study approach to some of the issues arising in the complex world of health care enforcement and compliance.  With emphasis on the procedural mechanisms of the False Claims Act and the substantive law of the Anti-Kickback Act, the Stark I and II laws, the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, and the government's remedial authorities, the seminar will explore how prosecutors, defense attorneys, whistleblowers, and compliance officials inside health care companies approach their work and advise their clients.  The seminar will explore the relationships between regulated industries (e.g., pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, doctors, medical device companies) and government insurance programs (e.g., Medicaid and Medicare), why these relationships generate billions of dollars every year in fraud, and how the interested constituencies are approaching these issues.  NOTE: This seminar does not satisfy the Upper-class Writing Requirement. ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 12 students. OFFERING PATTERN: This class is not offered every year.  Students are advised to take this into account when planning their long-term schedule. **A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.
