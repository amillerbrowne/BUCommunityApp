			<a href="http://www.bu.edu/academics/law/courses/law-jd-607/"><strong>LAW JD 607: Lawyering Lab</strong></a><br>
			            			The one-week intensive Lawyering Lab guides students to bring to bear legal concepts, core practice competencies and practical judgment to address simulated client problems and achieve a client's objectives within the bounds of the law --the essence of what clients hire attorneys to do.   This is done through lectures to provide necessary background, but more importantly through interactive discussion and "hands-on" exercises--both in and outside of class--that require students to actually do what lawyers do in solving client problems and achieving their objectives.    This includes (1) determining the client's goals; (2) determining the legal constraints and opportunities that affect the client's ability to get what it wants; (3) determining the relevant facts; (4) identifying multiple options for action; (5) assessing the various options to generate possible recommendations, (6) counseling the client; and (7) negotiating and drafting agreements.  1 credit, pass-fail.		</li><li class="dontsplit">

			            			This seminar will investigate constitutional history, from the years leading to the American Revolution through the coming of the Civil War, from several different angles, including presidential leadership, judicial interpretation, and legislative mandates.

Topics to be covered will include constitutional thought before and during the Revolution, the constitutional impact of the break with Britain, the origins and drafting of the Constitution, the political thought of various Founders, the development and implications of judicial review, launching the Republic during the administrations of Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison, and the growth of democracy in the Republic in the aftermath of the War of 1812.
